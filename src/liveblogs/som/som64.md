I'm nearly finished with this game! My god, it's happening so fast!

I go to Gold City to get more sturdier equipment and restock on our recovery items...

The Duck Helm for some reasons more harder in defense than the Dragon Helm...

I check my party's stats. Here they are so far...

I check on King Manmon. He's still living large and completely unaware about everything...

Checking the map, I might make a stop over at the Ice Country.

There's not that much places to go there...

I give up, and descend to our next destination, the **Tree Palace**.

It's a bit tricky to find a spot in the palace to land, but we find one!
