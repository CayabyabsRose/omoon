...into the entrance of Joch's cave, thank goodness. But there's someone missing again...

Jehk goes down the steps to congratulate us on passing his master's test!

**Jehk:** "You will master the Sword by joining courage, knowledge, and love."

**Jehk:** "**I am Joch. The old man was an illusion.**"

***Oh my god!!!***

Hero's reaction is nearly the same as mine at this point.

I'm guessing Joch wanted to test us by fetching the rest of the Mana Seeds' powers.

**Joch:** "You weren't ready yet. Your ears could hear, but not your heart. I waited for you to find your inner strength..." 

So I am right. He was, in a way, testing us!

Now our next task awaits...

We now have to stop Emperor Vandole and his minions from raising the Mana Fortress.

**Joch:** "Atop the coral you'll find the Tree Palace. Below lies the Mana Fortress. Something evil seeks the seals. **HURRY!**"

Everyone cheers as the party's health is restored.

So the sunken landmass southeast of the world is the Mana Fortress and the palace above is the Tree Palace...

I speak to Joch again, who wishes us "good luck!" He's not a person who saves games, I'm guessing.

At Mandala, I have Watts upgrade Excalibur into something more powerful...Masamune!

No superlatives are worthy enough to describe Masamune's benefits here!

I've got so much money...

Those enemies in Joch's cave are super-hard...plus, I'm regretting that I didn't take a screenshot of Joch's revelation.
