Now he has to find a way back up, and I now have control of Hero! So the A button, or the circle button, is a dash button, but I can only use it once as my character flashes when I do it. After a tiny beep is heard, I can use it again.

No menu to access, no jumping. I can only move.

Though the current of the falls is somewhat guiding me, I make it to solid ground.

The scenery looks so pretty.

A flash of light, and someone calls Hero by name...

I check the tall grass again. Nothing there.

I have Hero head south.

The white light, and the voice calls again...

I have Hero cross the log bridge, and see a sword lodged on a rock surrounded by water. This feels like the King Arthur legend all over again...

I'm a bit stuck, since a shrub's blocking the way, but I get out.

However, the way to the village is planted with shrubs.

Maybe that sword should work...

I press B, or the x button, and the white light guides us again to take out the sword. This is really suspicious...

<strong>Hero:</strong> "Who are you...?"

He's asking the right questions.

Hero yanks the sword out, and a bright light shines...

<img src="" alt="spectre" width="480" height="360" />

Who is this person? He says that he told Hero to remove the sword.

The light shines brightly, and another encircling aura shines around the Hero, and I can now see Hero's HP, and a gauge below!

I can now attack, and with the Y button, or triangle, I can see the equipment Hero has on hand!

A <strong>Rusty Sword</strong> is all he has.

Hero states that he can cut through shrubs with the sword now! Let's see it in action!

I try practicing with the controls cutting the shrubs and grass. So I have like a stamina meter below Hero's health display.

With nothing of value found yet, I head to the road east to the village after a while.
