Now we are transported before the Emperor, where Fanha notices us! In place of Sheex is an Imperial soldier!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oelayY9.png" alt="fanha prepare to" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

The Emperor tells Fanha to drop it for now, and starts to prepare for the Mana Fortress!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tFeNq8E.png" alt="fanha vow" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Fanha vows to take us down before leaving...

A bright golden light shines...

...and we proceed up the stairs...

Into a hall with more monsters to block our progress!

We turn on the tables on the Metal Crawlers with Hero's fire imbued weapon!

Down more stairs...

The area here looks more like Catapult or Ronka Ruins...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gOCzhH1.png" alt="metal crawler" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Plenty of monsters and ancient machinery down here...

We escape the two Capt. Ducks into an ancient conveyor belt...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/e9FEkJk.png" alt="conveyor belt" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

After taking care of two more Fierce Heads, we encounter another barrier...

It seems that we need to press a switch to proceed, and it's somewhere near the west conveyor belt...

There it is!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vrOizOT.png" alt="switch escalator" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

So the Kimono Wizard, I learn, spawns those dang Metal Crawlers!

Now we escape east, and after taking care of two Steelpions with Max's wind magic, we go inside the room...

Watts! How does this blacksmith keep finding us?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5ySPy4N.png" alt="watts is here" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

I upgrade the weapons we've received orbs from earlier: the Whip and Boomerang...

**Morning Star** to **Hammer Flail**<br/>
**Cobra Shuttle** to **Frizbar**

The Hammer Flail slows enemies, while the Frizbar's good against slimes and lizards...

There's Krissie and a Republic soldier here too!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VnU3Ubo.png" alt="krissie and soldier" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Krissie recovers our health!

We talk to the guard, who gives us important code he overheard from Imperial soldiers.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EXLUSEb.png" alt="rbgy" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Guard:** "'Red-Blue-Yellow-Green.'"

...I'll have to remember this, it might be a passcode to open a door in the city...

We head east of the hall, and make it to more chambers, where more Capt. Ducks await!

Westward, we get into another room with a set of conveyor belts.

Climbing that, more Imperial troops, and remnants from Thanatos's forces, await!

We jump down a ledge, and face off against more monsters and a stubborn Capt. Duck!

More endless monsters later, we come across a room with four transparent tiles in the middle, with the north one pushing us down, and a barrier to the west.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5tLE9L8.png" alt="four tiles" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

For some reason, stepping on the center tile lowered the barrier. There must be an invisible switch here...

Next room, we seem to be at a pool of sorts...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/E5ygL4h.png" alt="pool" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Ahead, more monsters like the Shape Shifter await!

I switch Hero to the whip...

A hall of these gray blobs meet us!

I switch Hero's weapon again to the Boomerang...

Half of the Shape Shifters transform once again. I decide to slow them down, which actually works!

I use the whip and Speed Down combo to slow the Capt. Ducks down...

Looks like a Dark Stalker's in the building as well!

No, two of them!

We take care of them, and see four consoles with color-coded buttons in the center...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EWSdEWZ.png" alt="four buttons" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

The Republic soldier tolds us the code to open this barrier is **red**, **blue**, **yellow**, and **green**...

I switch Hero to the fist to activate the switches.

That did the trick!

Instead of going down there, I head west down some more stairs to face against more Metal Crawlers...

After a whole runaround and another recovery from Krissie, we make our laborious, monster-filled trek back to the consoles, where the Dark Stalkers there give Max a two-hit death blow!

I take this chance to perform Pidge's Revivifier spell, resurrecting Max!

In the next room, we're surrounded by Kimono Wizards!

While I have Max spam wind magic, I hit the switch near here, lowering more barriers!

Max's wind magic's now at level 6, and the Air Blasts are now mini-vortexes...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7grem8T.png" alt="mini-vortexes" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

We climb down the long staircases...

...where a small wave of two troops await us! Taking care of them, and crossing into another long conveyor belt..,

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xMJfBWB.png" alt="long conveyor belt" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

It's a never ending parade of Imperial forces here. Seems like The Emperor's not making this easy...I'm remembering a note I made back at the Imperial castle, saying "If this is the best the Empire has to offer..." I take it back. This is mostly the Empire's elite we're facing at this point...

There's a hall of turnstiles before us next, and a Capt. Duck!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/b6fOtyC.png" alt="subway turnstile" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Ahead, we see a subway train!

My guess of this game being set in a post-apocalyptic world is right on here!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eMhRWZr.png" alt="subway train" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Now boarding...

...where tons of Ghouls are seated in the passenger cars!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/E9EdJWD.png" alt="ghouls on train" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

We press on, fighting more Ghouls! At least they're easy compared to the other monsters inside the city...

At the end of the car is an Eggplant Man...and Needlions!

One Needlion takes out Pidge!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UfO3q99.png" alt="end of car" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

After they're gone, I revive Pidge and debark the train...

At the other end of the station, a determined troop of Shape Shifters and Captain Ducks are our greeting party!

I press another switch in the east booth, lowering the barrier here!

<a name="5"></a>

---

Oh my god, there's **more** passages!?

And the Dark Stalker here KOs two-thirds of the party with his endless Shurikens!!!

I revive Hero as a last resort!

Knowing we can't fight him in our condition, we escape into a spare room...

...where the Scorpion Army awaits us!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jY7ahdj.png" alt="hey you" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Looks like the boss knows who Hero is now!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MYOBkU4.png" alt="legendary knight" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/D2Hq095.png" alt="hand over blade" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

I have no time to face you guys...

One of the minions in green mentions how much riches they're going to receive once they take the Mana Sword from Hero!

The boss tells him to grab the sword! But, the boss decides to take it by another way...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CI2jafz.png" alt="turbo robot!!" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Another robot?!**

**Kettle Kin**'s their new robot?

Into another boss battle we go!

<a name="6"></a>

---

I revive Pidge, and analyze this robot. He has no weaknesses...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/laUPGRe.png" alt="kettle kin" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

The robot casts a Lucid Barrier, and taking advice from the online guide, I spam him full of Air Blasts!

Since the robot keeps playing the Lucid Barrier game, I have Pidge cast Lucid Barriers as well.

The Air Blasts seem to lose their power...

The Thunderbolt spell's more effective against the robot!

Second Thunderbolt! Now take that!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vIfl0Oo.png" alt="kettle kin done" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

I get a **Bow's Orb** as my prize.

Fearful of the Mana Knight in charge, the Scorpion Army flees!

We're now back at the surface!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sxYo9um.png" alt="up to surface" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Inside the Tree Palace's doors we go...

...where a **Heck Hound**, or a Hellhound, awaits!

Tired, I decide to go back out, summon Flammie, and recover our wounds...
