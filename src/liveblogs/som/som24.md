The people here are still wandering about the ruins...

There's Phanna!

We try and talk to her. She looks at us with daggers, but says nothing, until she does.

**Phanna:** "...Pidge, I'm going on a one-way trip! Pretty neat, huh?"

Pidge tries to break Phanna from Thanatos's magic grip, but no good. She hits Pidge!

She brushes past the cultists...

Pidge shoves the cultists away, who walk into the ruin...

**Pidge:** "Unless we hurry, Phanna's a goner. Dyluck's probably here too!"

We enter inside the ruin...<a href="https://youtu.be/MNDMGSWfVq0">the music sounds...creepy</a>. Just after we enter, Hero tells the party to watch out!

There's enemies here as well! Two **Zombies** and one monster, the **Tomato Man**, that looks like a red <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa_(folklore)">Kappa</a> on top of a flying platform!

We get overpowered immediately!

I accidentally switch to Pidge, Max gets poisoned by one of the Zombies, it's chaos!

The Tomato Man's a spellcaster, too, huh?

I imbue Max's weapon with Ice Saber, and it's the first time we turn a monster into a snowman! Undine wasn't joking about that spell...

The Zombies keep regenerating...

We head into the next door!

More Chess Knights await...

After beating them, we head downstairs...

As we get deeper, the ruin gets foggier.

I'm tempted to use the Magic Rope to escape at this point, but my curiosity gets the better of me here...

In the hallway, we come across an **Evil Sword!** Those enemies remind me of those sword monsters from the **Castlevania** series, except there's no invisible wielder guiding them...

And more enemies appear!

So the Tomato Man's the one that's spawning the Zombies!

Since he casts Fireballs, I rain some hail on him! He's vulnerable to ice spells, and goes down on one hit!

Overwhelmed by the numerous monsters, I head into a door...

...into a room where two Evil Swords and a Tomato Man reside!

Max gets his first magic level up!

We take care of the Tomato Man and one of the Evil Swords asap.

The Evil Sword can cast Moon Saber, turning into gold...

...it attacks Pidge, absorbing her health!

We finally finish it off!

This room looks pretty nice...

Back at the hallway, three remaining enemies gang up on us again as we try to flee further downstairs!

The flooring in this room looks different...

Another Tomato Man!

Since Max is low on magic, I have Pidge cast Ice Saber on everyone!

And the Tomato Man spawns a Zombie who slows Hero down with his spell...

We manage to run away from them...

Oh my god, there's a lot of Tomato Men here!

Now in the next room...

How long is this ruin?

Not very, as we're now before a semicircle of masked cultists...and a staircase in the center of the room going up to a dais...

At the head of the stairs, is a robed figure in a skeleton mask...that's probably **Thanatos!**
