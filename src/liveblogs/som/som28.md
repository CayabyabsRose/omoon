I sort of overprepared myself before taking on the Wall Face...

The townsfolk are now back to their former selves!

So she might not have been under Thanatos's control after all...

Inside the castle, there's now fewer people inside...

One of the guards near the throne tells us the King's in his bedroom.

The Chancellor didn't expect Hero to save the day!

The King's maid tells us that the King's happy again!

The Queen gives us our thanks and tells us to visit Pandora anytime.

Now we talk to the King...

...who congratulates Hero for saving the citizenry!

He mentions that Jema told him about Hero and the Mana Sword, but didn't believe him. The King, knowing that Hero's the foretold "knight in the legend," lets Hero have what's inside the treasure house.

The guard goes downstairs...

...and so do we!

That's a lot of treasure! I wonder what's inside?

It's mostly four helpings of 50 gold pieces, and...another **Sword's Orb**, and another **Spear's Orb**, meaning it's time for another upgrade!

I leave the castle and go to the armor shop here to check their wares.

The only thing new here is a **Cobra Bracelet**...

I buy that and another Power Wrist, sell some unneeded equipment, and we're off!

We head to the two children's house, where the parents have been released from Thanatos's control!

The father vows to protect his family no matter what, and what the mother says here, I also agree with...

**Mother:** "For the sake of the children, I don't want war."

We visit other houses. The blond man with the awesome kitchen is still denying stuff. One man outside says he felt like he "had a dream." 

The grandma who was also under Thanatos's trance is back, but it turns out that her granddaughter is Pidge's friend, Phanna, the blue-haired girl... :worried:

It seems I've got four weapons to ask Watts to upgrade now...

We leave town and take a cannon to Gaia's Navel once more...

Inside Watts's forge, where I have him start upgrades with the Bow first, which becomes a **Short Bow!**

Next, the Spike Knuckle, reforged into the **Power Glove!**

~~It's so bad...~~

Finally, the Broad Sword and Heavy Spear, which cost 400 each to upgrade!

Watts's handiwork gives us the **Herald Sword**, which looks like a mighty katana, and the **Sprite's Spear**, a long, blue spear!

The Herald Sword's a bane for slimes and lizards, while the Sprite's Spear has a chance of "ballooning" enemies! The "very bad" Power Glove also has a new effect: the wearer can cause extra damage to insects!

After resting, we do more level grinding, and take a cannon to the Water Palace!
