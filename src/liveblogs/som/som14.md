Back to the salescat, where we restock again and save.

I wonder what the Barrel's effects are? Knowing how pricey it is, it might be a helpful recovery item...or is it?

Agh, these Chobin Hoods! Their arrows are painful and they respond more faster than we can can recharge!

We make our way down into the floodwaters, and into the west cavern behind the waterfall...

I fall for another chest trap!

The **Kid Goblin**'s formidable, while the **Green Drop**'s hard to hit unless the party's at full strength. They can also split into smaller pieces (like how Slime monsters usually do), and are poisoners.

Eventually, we force ourselves to retreat further into the cave since the Green Drops keep multiplying!

The Kid Goblins are easy to surprise when they're alone, since they're usually sleeping...

Crossing further into the depths of Gaia's Navel now...

In order to cool off the lava, we need to clear that piece of land blocking the water. But how to do it? Hmmm...

I ignore the problem for now, since there's another tunnel further in west.

More Kid Goblins here. I also notice a skull lodged in the wall, which I have Hero hit.

A rush of water sounds...

...and the lava's gone!

Into the south tunnel, where we disturb a Kid Goblin slumber party...

Seeing a Green Drop in the northwestern part of the cavern, we head down...

We crisscross through the underground river, taking care of more monsters.

We run into more trouble, and its name is Green Drop...

Down more stairs, and into a monsterless area.

I wonder where these stairs lead to? And why were they broken?

Upstairs to another chamber, where we take care of another Kid Goblin and hit another skull switch, causing the chunk of land in the middle to sink...

Back downstairs, <a href="https://youtu.be/Pyh-76qdVeU">the music's changed into something more festive-sounding now.</a>

The piece of land's a bridge to the **Village of Dwarfs!**

One dwarf mentions a Sprite's child who got pulled by the waters and down into the village...

Seeing the closest inn, I have the party rest and stop here.
