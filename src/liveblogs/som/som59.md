On the climb back up, we see a familiar face...

I check out Neko's wares after I take care of the Bomb Bees around here.

It's exactly the same stuff the merchant in Mandala has...

I also save here.

Back at Joch's cave...

Oh my god, lol...I'm laughing at this point just to keep myself from getting frustrated...

So Sage Joch's now at the **Republic of Tasnica**, huh?

I'm guessing that every time we complete a quest, Joch just magically sends messages to Jehk where he's currently at, and orders Jehk to tell us where to go before we could meet him... This might mean that Joch is one step ahead of us, and is looking for the eighth Mana Palace. Or, maybe this whole scavenger hunt for Joch is a test that Joch himself is giving us.

We fly back to Pandora, and stop there for today!
