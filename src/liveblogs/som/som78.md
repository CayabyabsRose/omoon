I continue from my save state and have Pidge cast a barrier on all of us...but she's low on MP!

We run away from the Master Ninjas, restore Pidge's MP, and cast the barrier!

We keep a distance away from the ninjas, knowing how dangerous they are!

We nearly get finished...

Cutting through the crystals now...

...and three Terminators block our way northward!

They cast more barriers on themselves to repel our physical attacks...

We run ahead, warping to a higher part of the fortress...

Another warp...

...where we meet Thanatos and Dyluck!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/L37OPfn.png" alt="thanatos again" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

The conversation begins...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Y9xOs2x.png" alt="for ages" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Thanatos:** "...for a human with the power to conquer this world...one born in the shadow of darkness, and raised in the light of Mana."

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8qCvWSP.png" alt="i can't wait" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

So that's why he chose him!?

**Thanatos:** "It is time! Using his body, I will take the Mana Fortress, and rule the world!" Oh no, you don't...

Pidge tells Dyluck to fight him...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Wa05q8F.png" alt="resist" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Then she steps in and attacks Thanatos!

Uh oh...

Thanatos vanishes...

Pidge asks Dyluck to wake up, and asks if he's alright...he asks where he is...

But the transformation is complete...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RTILHO8.png" alt="i feel strong" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Pidge says he's lying...no, it **is** Thanatos!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nSnvmVw.png" alt="liar" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Wwdn4B1.png" alt="can't move" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Then we hear Dyluck's voice, as <a href="https://youtu.be/3dhpIEerwng">"Fond Memories"</a> plays again...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XMDv3AH.png" alt="it's me dyluck" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Dyluck:** "He's too strong...I'm finished, but I can help you...**Thanatos is an ancient sorcerer who sold his heart to the underworld. Though his life force is eternal, he hasn't his own body. His life force is growing darker. He feeds on hatred and destruction!**"

Thanatos tries to shut him up...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bLQLKrt.png" alt="dyluck won't see again" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**No...**

Dyluck tells Hero his parting words...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TOK3AIg.png" alt="take care of pidge" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/clvl2Lz.png" alt="stop it!" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

No...

The body of Dyluck (or Thanatos himself?) begins to transform...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/K7F8FCP.png" alt="i must withdraw" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Thanatos:** "**Give me your bodies!**"

<a href="https://youtu.be/cPJgzbGwdyI">The theme's fast-paced, with remnants of creepiness from Thanatos's theme...</a>

We're now up against the **Dark Lich!**

As I analyze the Dark Lich, he vanishes!

Like most monsters like him, he's weak against Lumina!

His skeletal hands peer out!

I have Pidge enchant Hero's sword with light magic.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Vr6GNAm.png" alt="enchant sword" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

As soon as the Dark Lich's face surfaces, I strike! But it does little to no damage on him!

When the Lich makes fists with his hands, my allies go down!

I have Hero charge the Sword to full power...and it's super-effective!!!

Now the Dark Lich rises...

...and casts a Balloon Ring on Max!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/A1O8EBE.png" alt="dark lich face" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Now the Dark Lich starts casting Dark magic on Max!

He hides underneath the floor again...

I repeat the charging strategy...

...he resurfaces, blowing out Poison Gas and more dark magic on Pidge!

He sinks once again...

...eventually Pidge and Max get KO'd again by the Lich's hands, even as I switch their AI to keep away from the boss!

I eventually recover the party and use the last Walnut to restore Pidge's MP!

I resort to using two Lucent Beams on the Dark Lich, which are super effective, but take a chunk of MP!

Now it's a spellcasting exchange between the Dark Lich and Max!

He vanishes once again, but I charge and strike once his head is visible!

Another spellcasting duel, where I spam Fireballs until the fireworks appear for the Dark Lich! Goodbye, Thanatos...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KoDNoBP.png" alt="goodbye thanatos" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

No celebration music...

But we get something even better...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BHB3FMI.png" alt="dryad powers back" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

But there's someone missing...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YBkI1Sy.png" alt="ooh dyluck" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Poor Pidge... :frowning2:
