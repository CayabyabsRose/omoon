I start off with a few warm-up battles here...

The scenery's beginning to look more whiter...it looks like the trees and shrubbery are covered with snow...

Up ahead, we face the dragon! This is definitely not Flammie!

It's a **Snow Dragon!**

Analyzing the dragon now, but I have Max cast fire magic on him before the spell's complete!

I have to watch out for his scorpion-like tail!

I have Pidge cast barriers on all of us!

The Analyzer confirms the dragon's weakness to fire, and I continue to have Max spam fire magic!

The Snow Dragon's raising his head like he's about to inhale...

He casts a Freeze on Max, but no damage done!

He flies away...

...and comes back, with his icy breath on Max!

Max turns into a snowsprite!

But after curing him, and with one last salvo of Fireballs, the dragon goes down!

We win a **Bow's Orb!**

We return to the gate...

I wonder why the guardian doesn't heal us too?
