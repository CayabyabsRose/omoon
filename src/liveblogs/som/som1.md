Okay, let's get started with this game!

<a href="https://youtu.be/T6YAiLHXw_c">The intro music sounds pretty nice...</a>but I accidentally skip ahead...

...and now I'm in the menu screen, and I can't move my cursor for some reason. I can press B, or the cross button, though. Maybe it's because I haven't saved anything yet.

Now what should I name my character?

I'm not very good with names, so I'll stick with <strong>Hero</strong>.

Now the real game begins...

<img src="" alt="narration" width="480" height="360" />

"<strong>Using the power of Mana, a civilization had grown strong...In time, Mana was used to create the ultimate weapon: the Mana Fortress.</strong>"

A <strong>Mana Fortress</strong>...uh oh...

"<strong>This angered the gods. They sent their beasts to destroy the Fortress. A violent war rocked the world, and Mana seemed to disappear. Before all was lost, a hero with the Mana Sword smashed the fortress into pieces...</strong>"

And time moves on, Manaless, according to the narration.

"<strong>But time flows like a river...and history repeats.</strong>"

That's not a good sign...

Whoa, nice Mode 7 graphics!

But, where am I being sent to?

So here's the Hero, crossing a large log before a waterfall telling his two friends, Timothy and Elliott, that their Elder might be mad at them if they're caught sneaking out to where they're going.

So what is the place they're going to?

A ghost!? Timothy thinks that's meant to scare them.

But Elliott mentions his grandma seeing something shiny near the falls, and the threesome are off to find this "shiny" treasure.

Oh my god, the Hero slipped and fell!

Lucky he's okay!
