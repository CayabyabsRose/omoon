It's been nearly four years since I played this, let's hope I remember some stuff...

And here it is!

Okay, which difficulty should I pick? Maybe since I played this once and barely survived, I should try normal...

I choose normal like on my previous playthrough...

"**Our world has fallen to fade...what was once a land of promise led to the ravages of war...**"

Now I'm in a fiery-looking scene that I mentioned that it looked like something out of a scene from *Kung Fu Panda* when I first played this game...

After a while, I'm told that my character (Jub'f npghnyyl jbexvat sbe gur nagntbavfg urer) gets defeated...

"**Not to the mob, but by a single child.**"

**Wva...**
