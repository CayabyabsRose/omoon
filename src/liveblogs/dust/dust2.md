Now we're in a place surrounded by a bed of flowers, and a floating sword comes to awaken the person!

Once the sword comes to him, he wakes up, and doesn't remember anything from what happened earlier...

A small orange foxbat, or nimbat, also comes flying into the scene, huffing and puffing...

Oh my god, it's Fidget! Oh my god! :D :D \*squeeing internally\*

Fidget is one of the reasons why I wanted to play this game again, because she's so funny! Thanks to this game, she's now one of my favorite VAs to listen to, with Dust's voice actor coming in second!

But, wait a minute, why did the talking sword choose him for?

The person I'm now playing is Dust, and I was chosen by the Blade of Ahrah. I now go down the choices, and Fidget is not backing down until she gets Ahrah back.

Oh Fidget, good try, but never challenge a guy with a sword unless you're really good at fighting...

But she's not leaving since she needs to look after Ahrah and decides to go along with Dust.

Dust is confused about what he should do to get his memories back. Ahrah tells him to go east for answers.

Now I finally start moving! I go west instead from the bed of flowers, and find a key!

Here's the menu!

Here's the upgrade part of the menu...good lord, it really has been a while since I played this...

I now head east...
