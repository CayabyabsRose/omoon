Let's get going!

Now more monsters join the fray!

I get a prompt for a fighting move here...

I get more prompts for more moves as more monsters draw near!

I can't go to the next area until they've been taken care of...

Now I get a new move!

I get more instructions from Ahrah on how to use this move, and perform it, which is a spinning, blurry whirlwind.

Fidget steps in, about to demonstrate her..."awesome" power.

...which is a few small bulbs of light...

<img src="" alt="" width="" height="" />

Oh Dust...

Ahrah, however, now has Dust, and Fidget demonstrate their combined moves in front of the horde.

The power of teamwork!

I take care of the monsters without using the Dust Storm though.

Now it's raining!

More monsters, and I press the circle button, which uses Fidget's power, and the triangle button uses the Dust Storm...

After taking care of more monsters, I make my way out.

I see another save monument and record my progress.

More troops await our band at the base of the cliff now.

I jump up and then head back under the cliff to take care of more troops!

I get another note!

I get some materials as rewards from my fights. Fbzr bs gurz zvtug or cerggl hfrshy gb znxr n pregnva qbyy gung V'q jnag gb xrrc.. sberire...yby...

I eat a fruit and break a wall forward!

This draft is huge!

I manage to fetch a Treasure Key from that area, and I jump back up to the high ground.

I also noticed that Fidget is also a stat. My goodness, it has been a while since I played this game...

More monsters attack as I cross the log bridge...

<img src="" alt="" width="" height="" />

I get a cupcake as a prize from one of the monsters.

After taking care of some more troops, Fidget has good news...

<img src="" alt="" width="" height="" />

...and Ahrah says I can upgrade my stats!

<img src="" alt="" width="" height="" />

I decide to get more health!

Still trying to get the hang of combat, though...

Now I'm at the area where I'm supposed to be.

Fidget senses a chest!

<img src="" alt="" width="" height="" />

Hmmm, more details about Dust's past, though small, come to light...

Fidget doesn't know much about the details of the area, as she dropped everything while she was chasing after Ahrah.

Ahrah asks if Dust knows about the village farther east...

We press onward into the valley below...
