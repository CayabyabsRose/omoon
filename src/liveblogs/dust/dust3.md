Sorry for the lateness of this post! Anyways...

...here I am, at the Glade!

I'm still trying to get the hang of taking photos from a PS4...

Awww, cute critter...

I can't double jump though...

I'm now near a piece of wall, which I break easily with Ahrah's help.

That's an obvious nod to Castlevania right there. Who puts chicken inside walls though?

Fidget mentions that she has a "sixth sense," making her notice things that's up ahead...

The water drips from the cliffs also touch Dust's hat, now that's very detailed!

I get a sphere ball from a pillar, which tells me I have to power to dash now! I head back.

I get a note mentioning something about treasure now...

Now I run into a chest.

**Dust:** "Correction: we found a locked chest."
**Fidget:** "Well, what are you waiting for? Smash it open!" Oh Fidget... :D

Ahrah mentions I need a key to open this chest...

I can't crouch in the crawlspace west of the chest though...

After playing an "open the lock" minigame with the chest, I get more food and a Revival Stone...

First time I noticed this, but this game has a Disney-movie-meets-an-anime kind of look to it...

Now the first monsters appear in the game. Fidget's response:

**Fidget:** "No, no! Mash the buttons! DO SOMETHING!"

I laugh a bit as I mash the square button, taking care of them.

Poor Fidget...she was unprepared.

Dust thinks things are going to get a lot worse. I agree.

Ahrah points out our next destination. So that's why he said "[Dust's] answers lie in the east..."

Fidget gives me Feeble Fruits knowing we're going to be in a bigger mess. I wonder why she didn't give those Fruits just after we woke up...

Looks like I hit my first save point. The *Castlevania* influences are strong in this game. I stop here for now.
