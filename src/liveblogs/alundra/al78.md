I'm betting Cephas and Nava didn't say anything partly because of Ronan's influence, and they probably didn't want the villagers to know about their secrets, but now that's he's gone, they now ask us to finish Melzas once and for all...

Okay, after a week off of trying to write these liveblogs because of other stuff, I'm back! (**Note:** I typed this part on my phone way back in March 25 and the previous post on March 15)

Oh my god, it feels empty here in the village now...

The Sanctuary is locked, meaning everyone's safe for now...

The reach from the new sword is wider now! The charge attack from the Holy Sword has more fancy effects too, showing off its power!

I can take care of most enemies in one hit from the sword!!!

I get the Strength Eliyxr from the chest in the area north of the Fire Manor.

More exploring...

The only shop left is Lurvy's. Hopefully, his shop is open. And it is! I buy a Wonder Essence from him.

I now head off to Nava's Cabin...
