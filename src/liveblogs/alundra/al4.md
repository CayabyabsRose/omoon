[Here is the music for Tarn's Manor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX8Mr1TbkMI)

I head back to Tarn's Manor, and as soon as I'm at the gates, some monkeys with wolverine claws came from the manor and jumped at me! Nothing was stolen and no harm done though!

Now I'm inside the manor proper. Melzas warns me with his big, blue spectre hologram body, and locks the doors with his mind, and more monkeys jump at me!

I go in the formerly locked door in the center of the hall into the dining room where more monkeys start jumping at me!

I beat them and get a chest of strength tonic for my trouble, which I can't carry since I already have one.

I explore around the manor some more and am now at the basement of the manor. Two slimes are there to greet me.

A huge rock falls on me as I move forward, ouch! I now see why Alundra can dash.

I do more simple puzzles and get more treasure, such as herbs and a Gilded Falcon! I'm wondering what the falcon does though...

There's a lot of spiked balls in this manor. I wonder if Tarn had a thing for spiked balls.

After the sewage exploits, I get a Life Vessel upgrading my health yes!!!

I'm now back at the main entrance, and after getting the tonic, I head upstairs. The suits of armor creep me out though, it feels like they might attack me for some reason.

The monkeys with wolverine claws are a bit troublesome, and I use the key from the sewer to open the door in the middle of the hall.

I go in and get the **Book of Elna**, probably the thing that Septimus asked me to find.

Melzas introduces himself to Alundra, giving out vague threats again by hologram. Yes, I've heard your stuff before, pleasegoaway.

No boss though? Pretty anticlimactic.

After checking my menu for the book, I head back to the village.

Jess criticizes me for going into Tarn's Manor alone. Well, at least I got my thirst for adventure quenched.

I like the way the save points are recorded via diary, terms like "checking the parchment," and the "tale has been recorded successfully" makes it feel a bit immersive.
