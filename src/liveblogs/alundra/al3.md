There's a church here, but the door is locked, I wonder if I'm able to get in there soon...

I talk to a gravekeeper named Cephas who thinks cemeteries are representations of heaven.

I meet my first enemies here too, hello Slime and Wasp!

A watermill with three treasure chests are there, but I can't seem to reach it, since iron bars are in the way, oh well...

I arrive near the gates at Tarn's Manor. I explore some more around the area though.

I end up going to a cabin at the beach, and someone named Nava tells me to leave for my own safety. Huh? What does he mean?

There may be no lifeguards on duty in the beach, but there are fire-breathing rock turtles on duty!
