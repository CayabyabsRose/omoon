He warps me into another chamber, where I'm standing on a mass of...whateverthatis...

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pz3CkmLuXq4">The music now sounds more ominous, with more pipe organ</a>, and...did I just hear a heartbeat?

Now as...**oh my god, did his disembodied hand just grab me!?**

It lifts me up and drops me down, taking a huge chunk of my health!

Melzas now looks...like some mass of brain with huge eyeballs on his sides, and disembodied hands...

Let's see if I can take care of him!

He's also shooting arrows of light from above!

My god, he's so quick!

I die once, but a Wonder Essence saves me!

Now how do I hit him?

Wait, he's shooting those arrows from his eyes!

After a bit of a struggle, it takes a few slashes from the sword and a few Water spells to take care of one hand!

Oh god, his hand's back!

Ah, there we go, now I hit his brain!

I equip the Fire Wand to see if it hits him with extra damage!

I use up all my magic and restore it with a Magic Eliyxr!

Hoo boy, this is going to be tough!

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nAc4pFOpjg">I die again!</a>

If I'd known I was supposed to hit his head, this might've been a bit easier...
