[*Alundra*][al-link] is a PlayStation action-RPG video game in the vein of *The Legend of Zelda*, released on April 11, 1997 in Japan, and developed by [Matrix Software][matrix-sw]. The game was released in North America on December 31, 1997, and localized by the now-defunct [Working Designs][wds], well-known for their English translations of games such as *Vay*, *Popful Mail*, *Lunar: The Silver Star* on the Sega CD and its remake, *Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete*, also for the PlayStation. The game was later shipped to Europe as *The Adventures of Alundra* in 1998.

This is the main page for my playthrough of *Alundra*, which I played from **February 1, 2016** to **July 8, 2016**.
