After trying many times to repeat my performance on the log jumping waterfalls, I'm now back at the cliffs before the lair.

I push a boulder down the cliff from the west side pushing it eastward, which destroys the bottom one blocking the way!

I move east and gradually destroy the glowing red eyed statue head! Take that! It comes apart like the car in Street Fighter II!

I jump upwards to the northeast part, with the Spring Bean's help, take out another stone head, and grab a Gilded Falcon in the chest!

I wander around the area before heading into the arch to the portal chamber to save.

After reading the guide again, to get into the lair, I have to destroy three statue heads. I've already taken care of two, now I have to get the third one, which is near the Mt. Torla entrance.

I use the portal and while avoiding enemies, I head up to the lair area from the Mt. Torla entrance where the last statue head is.

Taking care of business on the stone head, a swishing sound is heard, meaning all the doors into the lair have opened!

I save again at the portal chamber, and off to bed I go!
