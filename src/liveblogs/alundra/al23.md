I head north of the desert, and I'm now at those cliffs of Lord Nirude, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOxxnwMidKY">where the ethereal music plays again.</a>

I start my ascent, and I find a chest containing a Strength Tonic, which I can't take with me because I have one already.

I wander west and jump on a huge stone foot and head into a cave.

I'm now at Nirude's Lair.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8kw3rfpmig">Here's the music for that place, the brass and flutes are sort of dominant in this piece.</a>

I see a small crack on the base of the ledge, and two treasures are at the top of the cliff.

Failing to get those, I head west into a hall of sitting golems. One of Miming's people see me, and raises the alarm. Since the way forward is blocked off, I go back.

Unfortunately, they now know I'm here, and the goblins are getting ready!

Miming, on the other hand, is hesitant to fight...

These goblins can jump really high!

All the doors to Nirude's Lair have been sealed shut!

After using a tonic and getting the Tonic from the chest, I go back.
