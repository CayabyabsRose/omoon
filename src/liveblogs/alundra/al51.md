Before I head near the watermill to talk to Meia, I get more treasures after looking in the guide to find them:

--A **Magic Seed (!!!)** from the cliffs on the east side of the Spring Bean pot around Tarn's Manor, burning thorns along the way<br/>
--A Gilded Falcon past a thornbed on a small passage east in the middle of the way down in the well near Lurvy's Shack

Now I can cast up to three magic spells!

**Meia:** "The gods will be sure to grant you the power needed to beat Melzas. Be careful, Alundra."

We both stare at each other for awhile before I go into the waterway.
