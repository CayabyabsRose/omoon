I reread the guide, and on the section after the Ancient Shrine (hopefully, I avoided spoilers there!) I found out what those stone arches do, but I have to turn them "on." I just hope it doesn't take too long...

The Desert Shrine, or the Sluice Gate area where I used the Sluice Key is the key to making that possible, so I head back there.

Unlike in the Zelda games, I think, the sword can be charged while moving!

Even though I have Merman Boots, the effects of the Long Boots still work!

I plant a bomb in the left lever, and as it explodes, I hit the right lever.

More rumbling's going on as the sluice gate starts opening...

The gate drains the water that is past the walls of the sluice shrine, giving me access to the lower ground outside, where an opening lies.

I go in, where a hall of kneeling statues are on each side. I proceed further.

The place I'm at now is surrounded by greenery, a temple like ruin of sorts. In the middle of the room, I see decorated floor panels laid out like this:

......**X**......<br/> 
.....**X X**....<br/>
...**X X X**...<br/>
.....**X X**....<br/>
......**X**......<br/>
   
The floor panels have an engraved symbol sort of like the Triforce...

A man appears encased inside a crystal...

"I am Berue. My wait for your arrival has spanned more than a millenium, Releaser. I will show you five Signs that bind this world."

The Sign of **Harmony**...the Sign of **Trust**...the Sign of **Wisdom**...the Sign of **Love**...and The Sign of **Courage**...

What I did is basically a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)">Simon</a> game five times, with the last two signs, Love and Courage, being the hardest since the lights came on so fast!

**Berue:** "I have witnessed all the signs of a true Releaser. Now I shall open the Gate which we crafted for you. Stand between the pillars to enter the portal of warped time and space, Releaser!"

The panels have now vanished along with Berue!

I go north to the area outside Nirude's Lair, where a stone arch has a blue-white light portal in between...I step in.

I'm now in this place...

The floating blue diary south of the gray crystal's dais is the save diary. I save and exit back out.

**\*exit portal whoosh\***

I explore around the map, activating the rest of the stone arches that I saw by going in them...

On the way to the Cliffs, I swim to an island and open a chest, containing a Life Vessel!!!

My health is now maxed out to 20!!!

I fall down the waterfall, and swim west. I climb the cliffs near the waterfall, finding two chests: a Strength Tonic, and a Gilded Falcon.

I go to Lurvy's to get more recovery stuff: herbs, a Magic Elixyr, and a Wonder Essence.

The portals I've activated so far are:

--Near the Watermill<br/>
--The Cliffs near Lurvy's Shack<br/>
--Near the Pond with the Whirlpools<br/>
--Near the Marsh<br/>
