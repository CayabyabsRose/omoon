I'm now in the Murgg's (the monkeys with wolverine claws) turf, a huge tree is their base. Looks like I'm gonna have to sneak in...

But there's no way to get through, so no choice but to go back.

Kline and the others greet me, and think the Murgg Woods and the Coal Mine are connected, and that the Murgg have been using tunnels to find the "Crests".

I explore the area some more...

I find Olen's house, and I realize I would have been at the Coal Mine sooner had I taken the northern path...

I cut more shrubs to look for more money and enter Olen's house.

The only thing good from the house was a Gilded Falcon from a chest. I return back to Inoa.

I talk to some kids, where the mayor's son Talis was like, "I'm not crying, you're crying," and the others were not going to think of taking up a mining job. Ever.

Sierra is in the way to Jess's house, and asks me to go to Sybill.

I try and get a Life Vessel from Naomi's shop, but it's worth 500 gilder!

I then go to Yustel and pay her to see where I should go next. I see the map of the whole game from her crystal ball.

Kisha is still mourning... :(

Giles is now wishing to petition the gods to bring Olen back to life. I'd sign that petition.

So I find out from Lutas on why Jess is so overprotective of Alundra (and me), his wife and son passed away, and knows death can be a short distance away... :(

Kline is preparing for war against the Murgg...

I also learn from Meade about this couple: Gustav and Elene, and their romance, or lack thereof. Elene fell for a miner, leading Gustav into a drunken rage, and hating them both, as seen by the bottles downstairs and the broken furniture upstairs...

Nadia, the girl that explodes something when she sleeps, is pining for Bonaire, the dude that calls us a dude, to notice her instead of "silly waves on the ocean."

Bonaire talks more about Jess producing more "righteous schwingry" and all that surfer slang. Phineas, his grandfather, thinks getting old sucks, except for senior discounts.

Grandpa Wendell boasts about Kline's archery skills.

Mayor Beaumont and Thyea talk about how one shouldn't take life for granted...

I go to Sybill now, and claims that while she's awake, she lucidly dreams the future. She asks me to take her hand into her dream. I accept.

**\*dream whoosh\***

It's Kline! What is he doing?

What the...!? Why is he now a werewolf!?

It's Zazan! With Melzas behind him looking on!

Oh no, it's one of the villagers caged up in the Murgg's prisons, and the Murgg are...going into his head?

**\*exit dream whoosh\***

**Sybill:** "Soon, Alundra, my dream will become a reality. They all do. That fact frightens me more than anything else. You have to help...*please!*"

I go back to Jess's house, where Sierra ships Alundra with Sybill, and leaves. I'm more of a shipper of the blond elf girl I saw at the game's opening with Alundra though.

Jess asks me to bring flowers to Olen's Grave in the Cemetery. The flowers smell nice.
