I rejoin the tale after I get the bouquet of flowers from Jess for Olen.

Now I'm trying to get more gilders (money) to get another Life Vessel for Alundra.

I meet these new lizardpeople enemies and try to hit them, but they're very good with their shield.

A path to a desert is blocked by a fallen tree, which I try to use a bomb to blow it up, but it doesn't work.

The quest to get 500 gilders for one Life Vessel continues!

These wasps are hard to hit!

More exploring leads me to find some rubble which I blow up to reveal a cave, with more blue slimes! A chest has an herb but I can't carry more than nine herbs!

There's also a platform on the water with that same symbol that I saw in the mines.

After taking care of the blue slimes, I get a treasure with a Wonder Essence inside, which revives Alundra fully in case he dies, yes!!!

Now I have enough money to buy the Vessel! Yes!!

There's a lot of ravens hanging around Inoa now.

It's graveyard time!

The gravekeeper that blocked the cemetery is now gone, I go into the house, where I head to its basement. The basement has these six silver huge chalice torches on top of coffins. I think I might get an item later to light them.

I'm now reading the graves:

**JAYLEN.
He had a passion for life.**

**LYMAN.
He loved his work. We don't know why.**

**ZANE.
His smile will continue to brighten our memories.**

There are also a few empty plots around the graveyard too. I'm betting more people are going to die in this game... :(

Finally, I look at Olen's grave:

**OLEN.
Loved by all, feared by none.**

I put the bouquet on Olen's grave, and Alundra prays silently.
