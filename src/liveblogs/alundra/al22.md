After checking the map and the guide again, I find out that I missed a few things and I tail back to the desert.

I don't speak to anybody as I leave for the desert again.

Now I try to get the third chest I missed while I was there...

After s jumping spree where I have to jump on temple pillars, I make it to the chest, which has a Gilded Falcon inside.

I move west and head into a cave.

Inside is a bunch of scaffolding that I try to jump through.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNv9BmLn8Mk">The music here's pretty mysterious.</a>

If I had double jumping, this would be the perfect time to use it.

I manage to make it though, and open the chest inside, which contains a Sluice Key!!!

I touch the glowing cylinders behind the chest, which damage me. These are pretty hot pillars.

The Sluice Key is a key to the Desert Shrine that I went in last time, but couldn't get in because it was locked.
