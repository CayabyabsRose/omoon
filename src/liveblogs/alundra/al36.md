Since this one's a short part, I'll leave some of the rhetorical questions I have for the game so far here:

**After thinking about what Jeal said, does that mean that most if not all of these guardians were once human?**

**Or how is it that by trying to take on Melzas himself is also "taking a risk on reality"? Does that mean Alundra and the rest of this universe are basically living under Melzas's control, and everyone doesn't know it yet?**

**Meaning the villagers dying off is not a coincidence...I bet Melzas may be using their dreams somehow and placing monsters inside these people's minds to kill them. But for what purpose? And why?**

**And what about the consequences of slaying the lizardpeople here? Or are they "Chaotic Evil"? Because I don't think they're like the Murgg, the Murgg may have been controlled.**

After I exit the lair, it looks like I used up all of my recovery items fighting **Reptilicus Maximus** and his lizardpeople!

While taking out my frustrations on other enemies, I equip the bow. The mudmen take 6 hits from it to go down!

I go to Lurvy's, buying off everything on the table.

Afterwards, I head to the Northern Lake, and place the Sapphire Crest on its pedestal.

Crests obtained and placed so far: **Ruby** and **Sapphire**
