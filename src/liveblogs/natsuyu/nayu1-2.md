Who are these characters? Will we get to meet them in this episode?

Sasada's asking people to sign petitions to prevent a school from getting closed down...

Oh boy, another youkai!

Sasada felt the movement of the youkai...

Madara, or Nyanko-sensei, is back!

So some are after the Book of Friends for control, while others want their names returned...

Natsume's energy is spent everytime he releases a name.

Touko-san's there, and Shigeru-san is introduced here...

Oh, so that's the Dew God.

Ai ya, the page is stuck!

Unfortunately, it's stuck on another page since there's rice stuck to it...

And everytime the name is botched up, the person's body is played around...

So the Dew God is a wanderer...and his size is dependent on the number of people who worship him...

So the name next to him is bald...but the Dew God is not good at drawing...

So the woman, Hana, saw the Dew God once, and that's why she prays to him.

**Natsume:** "Being alone is lonely, being alone is painful..." Poor Natsume...

Madara-sensei sleepwalks in his true form, almost about to bite Natsume! :frowning2:

Madara tells Natsume to keep his guard up at all times.

Oh, so that's the youkai the Dew God was talking about...

Natsume tries the mirror, no good...

So he wants food...

Now two flashbacks...

**Reiko:** "**People are cruel and only care for themselves.**"
**Dew God:** "**But once you are loved, and once you have loved, you cannot forget it.**"

These two lines of dialogue kind of represent two people's different worldviews at play here. One who's been hurt by the world, and another who's been cared for by kind people.

Natsume explains the other god...

The Dew God got smaller now...and he's disappearing because Hana is almost dying...oh god no...

Awww...

Natsume gives some food at a shrine, but Madara takes one of the buns, and the entire bag!

What a kind person Natsume is...
