Natsume looks sad...

Who's that girl?

The other guy with the black hair looks a bit like one of my OCs, for some reason...

Oh my goodness, that cat...

**?:** "Where is she? Where did she go?" Who's chasing Natsume?

**Natsume:** "Ever since I was small, I could see strange things."

Youkai, they're called...

Reiko? 

Now that's a good kick.

Poor Natsume...

Wow, poor Natsume...

He trips and breaks on a rope...

Uh oh, a barrier?

Natsume tries to fix the rope...too late, the shrine opens! And a cat comes out! One of the youkai, I bet...

Well, at least the spirits know no gender.

So his grandmother was always alone...

The Book of Friends, or Yuujinchou.

Touko-san is his guardian...his interactions with her remind me so much of my interactions with my parents sometimes...

So he's an orphan, and it's been a month since he moved in, and he was passed from relative to "relative", none of them directly related to him, but they probably didn't want him because of his ability to see youkai...poor Natsume...

The cat spirit again...

Poor cat spirit...

**Cat spirit:** "My true form is quite elegant..."

Natsume waves a stick above his head: "You are a cat."

So Natsume's grandmother is the one who wrote names on the book as proof of her victories over the youkai.

And now the cat spirit has mentioned more rules: tarnish the names written in the book and the youkai get hurt.

Uh oh, the youkai mention that Natsume is his grandmother...

Natsume can run...he could pass for a Stride athlete...

The cat spirit is asking for...holy...he's now a huge elegant beast! He's like Keroberos (or Kerberos, or Cerberus) in *CardCaptor Sakura*!

So Natsume only keeps the Book of Friends as an heirloom, and he thinks the youkai are other people's problem...

He doesn't call his grandmother by her honorific...I'm thinking it might show distance towards her, maybe...

Now he vows to do something abt it...

Madara appears.

Wow, and he frees her by taking out the page, and blows on it.

Natsume's grandmother must be...clever...wow...

Oh my goodness...she was hit because of her ability to see spirits, or "being creepy". 

...and she never came back...

Poor youkai...Hishigaki is her name...

**Natsume:** "Thank you, Hishigaki, my dear grandmother's kind-hearted friend..."

**Madara:** "She was mean, wasnt she?"

My laptop battery's dying at this point, dangit!

Now back to the action!

Natsume accepts the task of freeing the Youkai from his grandma's book.

They go and eat steamed buns.

[The ED music sounds so calming...]()

That was a pretty good episode! Natsume's such a cutie!
