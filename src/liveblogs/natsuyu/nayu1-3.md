A girl's voice...no, its a younger Natsume...poor Natsume, he's sobbing...

There's another girl who says she can see what he sees too...

So Natsume tries to lay low in school...

Oh, it's that guy with the black hair from the opening...

So he has those two guys with him...

Another youkai to help, this one's face looks a bit funny...

Madara is back, and Natsume pts out that the cat smells of alcohol...

Madara brought back a little frog...

Touko-san tells Natsume that he should go out a bit. More youkai come to Natsume, and want their names back, no, they want more help. They want to exterminate a human.

Youkai exterminators?

Natsume rebuffs their offer.

The two youkai are back, and they really need his help, all the way to even following him to school...

It's that black haired guy again.

Who is he?

So these exterminators shoot blue spirit waves...

But Natsume wants to talk to the exterminators instead of helping the youkai...

The woman is back...

More youkai are now jumping all over them. Madara says they're easy pickings...

Poor Natsume...

Oh my god! What is that wave? Now Madara saves him, and explains that people with high spirituality can shoot waves like that.

What are those eyes glaring again?

So Tanuma is the black-haired guy, and he recently moved into the Eight Fields.

Poor Natsume...

**Woman:** "Are you lonely, Natsume?"

Oh my god, so the woman is a youkai too? Oh my god... :frowning2:

One of his classmates points out Natsume's similar to Tanuma. Tanuma is probably the exterminator.

The two youkai got zapped...

Uh oh, another high-level Youkai...

Misuzu is the youkai's name, and the small frog is his servant...

The two youkai want Misuzu to take care of Tanuma!

Natsume stops him! Who was that he saved?

As long as a youkai is bound to the Book of Freinds, Natsume can order them.

So Tanuma is not the exterminator, the Buddhist monk is purifying the forest to soothe them, but he's not able to see them...

His son is the Tanuma that Natsume's looking for, the black-haired guy.

Buddhist monks can't see youkai, since they were trained, not born with the spiritual power.

Awww...

Natsume: "Even so, I'm glad to have met them."

So Natsume and Tanuma meet...he doesn't see them, he says, but he feels their shadows...and he tells him about the rumors about Natsume seeing youkai.

Natsume confirms that he can see them...but he tells Tanuma to keep it a secret.

I wonder if it's a bit too soon to make fanfics of adventures with Tanuma and Natsume.

Natsume: "Being alone is lonely, and that the first step [to having friends] is scary."

Misuzu wants his name returned though, but Natsume holds it off.

Awww, the two youkai gave Natsume gifts...
