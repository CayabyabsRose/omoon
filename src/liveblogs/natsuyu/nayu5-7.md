So Natsume’s on his way to an inn that one of Tanuma’s relatives runs via train, to clean the place up while they renovate it.

Nishimura and Kitamoto and Nyanko-ssi join along!

Nyanko-ssi wanted to go bc of the sake!

Tanuma offers dried cheese codfish to the kitty. He’s happy and eats it in Natsume’s duffel.

Natsume apologizes to Tanuma for bringing him along. Tanuma’s a bit excited for the trip.

Nishimura hopes to find love on the trip there. He is the Lance of this show...

The train stops...

The innkeeper welcomes them, calling Tanuma “Kaname-chan.” Chuckles prevail. Tanuma blushes at the pet name.

So the innkeeper is Tanuma’s aunt, Aunt Satomi.

Natsume’s smiling at how well Tanuma is too.

Don't worry, Tanuma. I've been laughed at because of my name before.

So now theyve been given instructions to clean the room, with Aunt Satomi saying there’s a two day festival happening tomorrow.

Five guests are also at the inn.

So now theyve been given the annex as their room for the night.

Now cleaning time!

Tanuma says since theyre students they cant serve sake. Nyanko-ssi is not happy...

Tanuma pts out the festival has plenty of stalls, brightening that kitty’s day!

Natsume asks if he lived arnd the inn.

An old woman, Ito-san, greets Tanuma, ptg out how tall and how well he is now.

Ito-san also sees Natsume and asks if Natsume is Tanuma’s friend. She thanks him for being one.

Ito-san sees Nishimura and Kitamoto walking by, and she gives them candy.

Natsume’s smiling a snarky smile, saying he’s popular arnd here.

Tanuma tells Natsume he lived in the next town over before he moved in near Yatsuhara. He answered Natsume’s question from earlier, mentioning he looked less healthy than he was now.

When he got sick, he got sent to the inn where Aunt Satomi, Ito-san, and his dad cared for him.

They help arnd the inn some more, giving guests their meals and prepping their futons.

More onsen time for four boys and kitty...

Kitamoto’s dad snuck some photos in his bag. Nishimura sparkles and jumps at the “photos.”

Theyre ghost photos from inns. Natsume Tanuma and Nishimura look a bit creeped out...

After seeing the photos, they couldnt fall asleep so Pillow fight!

They eventually fall asleep...

Natsume dreams, but theres a squeaky creepy laugh he hears. He jumps up, rolling a grumpy Nyanko-ssi out of bed!

The youkai snuck up to the attic.

Nyanko-ssi pursues the youkai, thinking its stealing the sake, but he’s wedged bw the attic door.

Next morning, Tanuma knows something’s up. Natsume tells him abt the youkai sneaking in the inn last night.

Breakfast time for the four boys! But there’s a tray missing!

Natsume notices arnd the breakfast room that there were five guests, but there are six now.

Aunt Satomi said no one checked in last night, but that there are six now.

Natsume suspects the sixth guest was hiding alongside one of the guests.

Tanuma asks if youkai can appear to humans if they want to. Natsume confirms that, or disguise as a person.

He pts out how sad it was if a human was actually a youkai in disguise. True.

The four now help w more renovating work arnd the inn, with the three but Natsume moving furniture. Natsume decides to clean and inquire the guests.

One of them, Yuki-san, asks abt the festival dance.

Natsume suspects that they may have manipulated someone’s memories to sneak in to the inn...

One girl runs to the festival, the daughter and mother Mino.

A couple’s there: Hatanaka-san and Ootaka-san.

Mino Jr trips and falls. Eeee...

Natsume runs to get a first aid kit for the daughter Mino.

Akasaki is the last guest in the inn.

Oh boy I hope this ep’s like a whodunit!

Natsume hears a bumping sound beyond a door, and enters the storage.

Someone crawls in one of the ducts. Wait, is that...?

Ito-san shushes Natsume and tells her a festival mask was stolen, and tells her the thief is still in the inn! She suspects Natsume!

So Ito-san is the guardian of the mtn festival happening today, and she disguises herself as a person every year to watch over it.

But Natsume’s told not to tell anyone abt this or else she’ll kill him and anyone who knows!

She now asks for his help finding the thief, she holds a hand to Natsume’s neck.

She senses something amidst the guests. Natsume frees himself from her grip!

Nyanko-ssi intervenes, but he’s stuck on the panel!

She goes, as the festival is abt to start, and tells Natsume to look for a white woman’s mask.

Nyanko-ssi gets free, and hits a stack of boxes. Natsume tries to go after her, but bumps into Tanuma!

Tanuma brought the first aid kit to the Minos already.

Natsume’s abt to tell Tanuma abt Ito-san but stops himself, remembering what Tanuma said and what Ito-san warned abt earlier.

Nyanko-ssi divulges the info abt the thief and the mask. Natsume gasps and rubber faces the kitty...heh...

Now Tanuma knows...a bit!

The mask is important to the festival, as whoever has the mask has the power to ctrl things in the festival, Nyanko-ssi pts out.

Natsume asks why someone would want to pose as a human.

Nyanko-ssi: “Just to be a jerk!”

Natsume and Tanuma inquire the guests abt the missing mask. Without it, no evening dance Tanuma says.

Nishimura Kitamoto and Tanuma move a sofa, as the young couple passes by...

Nishimura asks Tanuma if he’s jealous of the cpl. No...

Natsume gives Akasaki a towel. Hmmm...

Natsume’s friends tell him they can head to the festival if they finish their work...

Tanuma has nothing.

Natsume asks the guests abt the white mask in the inn, starting w Yuuki.

I suspect Akasaki.

Yuuki-san remembers someone wearing and taking off a white mask, excited.

The Mino daughter’s wearing the mask!

No, she apologized, not knowing it was important. Though she saw someone else playing w it.

Now someone takes it from her and she faints.

Oh my god!

Ootaka’s the thief!?

Her boyfriend’s knocked out for now! So he was controlled by her just so she could steal the mask...

Well that’s a twist! So it’s the girlfriend in the whodunit!

 Madara pins her down, while Natsume tries to get the mask!

Ito-san arrives, taking the mask from Ootaka the youkai!

Tanuma’s pupils dilate, and he drops what he was carrying! He senses Natsume fainting!

A bit of a headache...

Natsume apologizes for not making it to the festival. Tanuma makes no fuss over it, mentioning that he first came to the inn during the fest.

He was excited, but he got sick...awww... :(

Then the next yr, he forced himself to go again, but then he got lost while enjoying himself...

Scared and lonely, he almost cried...but Ito-san cheered him up.
:)

Natsume thought Ito-san keeping her identity a secret from Tanuma was selfish.

The two guys come in and give Natsume riceballs!

Ito-san comes by and thanks Natsume for keeping her secret safe.

She’s relieved, ptg out “humans grow up so fast.” To youkai, time means nothing. She sees how Tanuma has grown too.

She doesnt play faves w humans, she says, that’s a bit of a lie. Nyanko-ssi knows it too.

She also tells Natsume to keep her true identity a secret for the second festival tomorrow.

Then after the fest’s over she goes to a different place in a different form...

She tries to float away but Natsume stops her!

Natsume pts out her flaw of keeping a secret, and he promises not to tell. In return he begs her to stay as long as she wants.

Ito-san pets Natsume’s head, she’s not reading his mind. She’s comforting him like what she did w Tanuma.

Natsume finally gets to go to the second day festival after making up the work he missed from yesterday.

Tanuma apologizes for not being there. Awww...such a good, considerate friend.

Ito-san’s there! 

But Natsume apilogizes to Tanuma in his head, unable to tell him about Ito-san...

The dance starts!

Tanuma remembers something: that he used to be frightened of Ito-san sometimes. Does he know? He felts like she was different somehow.

Tanuma: “Its like... I never thought ayakashi were real. But since I met you, Ive started to think that maybe she’s one.” Omg so he does know a bit...

Nyanko-ssi and Natsume get suspicious...

**Tanuma:** “But now, since I now have a friend like you, I came here because I wanted to show her my friend. Thank you, Natsume.” Awww...

I almost spoiled myself for the next episode! Whoops...
