I’ll admit that I got super spoiled for this episode, but the emotional moments here are so important and so emotional that I have to watch this!

Here we go!

Natsume’s walking by w cat in tow...

Nyanko-ssi wants his manjuu (red bean) sweets from Nanatsujiya. Natsume says Touko-san’s going to worry...then a crow flies by...

It starts raining, and Natsume picks up his kitty, and runs!

Natsume tells Touko-san that it’s raining, and worries abt the drying clothes! She and Natsume run to fetch them out of the line!

The night comes, Touko-san mentions the rain. No one saw that coming, but thanks goodness Natsume reminded her.

Natsume mentions the crows on his way back. Touko-san also recalls a crow too, now flashbacks...

Here we go!

Touko-san gives Shigeru-san his handkerchief!

She asks him what he wants for dinner. He doesnt know. She says that’s the worst answer ever! Im like that too, even Idk what I want for dinner...

Shigeru-san decides on fish, and leaves for work!

Touko: “This is an old house, but a big one.” Indeed.

So Shigeru-san’s family lived there for generations...Natsume’s room used to be the storage...and the grandfather clock hangs on the ceiling...

She mentions they had no children, and it was a fun place but quiet.

A crashing noise happens and a crow is trapped!

She  takes the tools away from the crow, and he flies away! Its fine! She tells the crow to be careful!

She sees the child in the supermarket and he pts to the fish at her. She also pts out the rest of the fish, mentioning the aji, or horse mackerel.

She’s now thinking of aquariums, and mentioning that if she had a child, she could make onigiri and take him and Shigeru-san out on a picnic to an aquarium...

She asks him if they want to go to an aquarium out of impulse. She says she’s too old for that sort of stuff but Shigeru-san says yes! Touko-san’s blushing!

They look at the fishes...

Next day, Shigeru-san asks for his funeral suit. His aunt on his mother’s side’s in law...technically theyre not related but he has to go...saying that they gave him a job when he was younger so he owes it to them to come.

Awww, this is the best couple next to Ahiru and Fakir...

He goes to the funeral.

Storm clouds are gathering.

“What are u thinking, bringing him here?”
“I told you were having trouble w him ourselves.”
“That again?”

The other talks about his son having exams and his wife losing it, one of them’s smoking...

“So you brought him here to force someone else to take him?”
“You dont need to put it that way.”
“Well we dont want him.”

Shigeru-san looks probably disgusted at what he’s hearing...

“When he was w us, all he did was say weird stuff and scare everyone.”

He looks up...

There’s Natsume!

He looks sad, lookign at him...

Oh my god...

Touko-san walks back to the supermarket, and worries if her husband ate, then the crow caws, its tail a lil bent...

She wonders if its a boy.

Awww, she also cares for crows too, calling them cute.

Once crows know you, they never forget abt you I think. Or is that elephants?

Touko-san yells out to the crow. Two students giggle at her attempt.

Shigeru-san’s back, down. He mentions nothing, but he’s thinking deep abt Natsume...

While Touko-san was chopping up green onions she hears a sliding door...

He’s moving and cleaning out the second floor room...restless...

Touko-san’s asking herself if theyre moving...

She thinks it would be nice and lively to live in town, but doesnt think that they could b leaving the house any time soon.

The crow caws at Touko-san while shes chopping stuff. Ppl shouldnt interrupt ppl when theyre chopping stuff. That’s dangerous.

Its raining and Touko-san gets the clothes quickly out of the rain! That was close!

They finished their fish, Touko-san mentions the crow that she saved.

Shigeru-san mentions that once crows have a partner, they stay together forever. Ones who havent are either looking or have lost them.

Take that Princess Tutu...

The crow’s all by itself...

The phone rings the next morning. One of Touko-san’s old friends from middle school calls her.

Shigeru-san tells her she can go visit her.

She mentions that she hasnt been on a trip in a very long time. And there’s the crow again. She tells the crow to watch over the house.

Touko-san meets her old middle school friend, and they start eating and going on trips and stuff.

They even see the ocean. Touko-san’s out of breath from climbig the steps...

At the hotel now, where she and her friend stay for the night.

Sana does not like wasting food, just like me, hee. She has a big lively family too.

In bed, Touko-san’s worried if Shigeru-san ate dinner and if he ate alone. Poor him...

The music’s nice.

**Touko:** “I guess I get lonely really easily these days. I went thru much worse things in the past. Happiness came pouring down on us so quielty, so peacefully. I miss you so much...” Now I'm interested about that backstory.

**Touko:** “If the day ever comes when I lose him, will I be able to survive? Even if he loses me someday, will he be able to survive? I want to get back to him...”

She’s crying...

Touko-san returns home. There’s Shigeru-san sleeping at the porch.

Shigeru-san now pts out what he saw during the funeral: Natsume, abt 14 or 15 yrs of age.

Shigeru: “Ever since he lost his parents he’s been going from one adopted family to another. And well...it doenst appear he’s being well treated. We have a room we arent using. It may b worse for a young boy to come out here to the ctryside...but he was so thin, and felt so detached from everything arnd him. If youll allow it, i want to bring him here.”

So Shigeru-san tells Touko-san she doesnt have to jump at the decision immediately, as he thought long and hard before mentioning this.

**Shigeru:** “This house is very important to both of us, so I want you to—“

Oh tears of joy form... :’)

**Touko:** “And you're so kind. I don't know why, but I'm crying.”

Touko-san “talked with relatives and then with each other for a long time,” and she now goes to meet Takashi Natsume.

There’s Touko-san going to the apartment...the gusty wind blows past her...

...and there’s Natsume running past her!

She goes to him in the dark cold alleyway...steeling herself to do this.

She now introduces herself to Natsume, who still thinks she might be a youkai...

She’s worried about him, and the conversation from season 3 continues...

Shigeru-san’s a bit shocked she talked to him...she apologizes, but he understands why she did it.

**Touko:** “He looked a little lonely, but he was a very good boy...”

**Touko:** “After that, we almost got into a fight with the family he was staying with, and some relatives weren't happy about it. But [Natsume] ended up coming to our house. He was a very quiet boy, but sometimes, they said he was a little unstable. And strangely, he did get hurt a lot. I worried, but when I saw him trying to smile, even if he was awkward...”

Now Shigeru-san is more decisive, wanting meat for dinner to feed Natsume, as Natsume’s too thin. Awww...there’s some character development for him too...

Natsume’s quiet in his “good mornings.”

**Touko:** “...The two of us want to protect him.”

Awww... :)

Three umbrellas at the door...

Touko-san tries to call out to Natsume, then the wind blows! More youkai after Natsume again!

He looks detached from everything, from Touko-san’s perspective.

**Touko:** “Sometimes his eyes are empty. As if his heart isnt here, and he’s lking far far off into the distance. How does he see us w those eyes?”

He sees you with those eyes because he wants to say that he cares for you, and loves you both.

**Touko:** “Will he ever open up to us? Tell us what he wants to do, or wants to have? As if he really was family. Someday...”

Now there’s Nyanko-ssi. Natsume quietly asks if he wants to keep the cat.

She smiles, ptg out his big head. And says yes. She also asks Shigeru-san abt Nyanko-ssi when he comes home from work...

Awww, Natsume’s smiling, a genuine one. I'm almost crying inside at this part...

**Touko:** “Little by little, little by little, I know we’ll...”

There’s the crow again, but he’s alone.

Natsume’s back and he helps her again w the laundry, he asks what she’s looking at: the crow, her friend.

Natsume pts out there’s two crows! Oh!

Uh oh...he mentions the crow’s partner being the wht crow.

Natsume mentions the white crow as very pretty.

Touko-san’s jaw slightly drops...uh oh...she now knows or maybe she does a bit... :frowning2:

Nyanko-sensei sighs, he knows she can't see the white crow...

The crow flies away with his invisible prtner. She smiles and she’s glad that the crow has a partner. Awww...

This is a good sign...she’s probably beginning to accept Natsume’s...ability, maybe?

Shigeru-san’s smiling at the two outside pointing out the crows.

**Touko:** “I'm sure that it’s shining a beautiful white, that it’s hard to see, isn't it?”

This is the best episode in the series ever!

Honestly seeing Natsume’s character development from the quiet person I saw in season 1 last year to this one is a bit jarring, and...I feel a bit emotional inside thinking about how far he’s come too.
