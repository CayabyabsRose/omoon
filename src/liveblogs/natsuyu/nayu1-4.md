Here we go!

There's a kappa lying on the middle of the road, thirsty.

Uh oh, someone saw. Oh no, it's her...

"Test of courage?"

The old school is about to be demolished?

Madara and Natsume banter on...

Now this is what a test of courage looks like...

A god of fortune who loved humans appeared to villagers in the form of a child, but a greedy man locked him up in a cellar and became an evil ghost, bankrupting the man, and the man built a school in this place...

The girl leaves.

There were supposed to be 20 in the lot, but 19 were available.

Oh ny goodness...

Owch, that's painful..

Is that the youkai? The youkai is angry that his house is about to be demolished.

Now this episode is pretty suitable for Halloween...

Nishimura (one of the two guys) is nowhere to be seen, but the girl knows he can see them, but she'll keep a secret...

She gets KO'd by Madara!

The youkai's closing everyone off.

Madara transforms into a girl, acting conceited...

Two puffball youkai here.

So Sasada, the girl, saw the youkai too...looking for her charm. But the youkai gives it to her, it's a memento from her mother...

So that's why she knows about the God of Youth...

Natsume confirms that he can see youkai to Sasada.

The God of Youth, or Shigure, is in the book...

Childhood nightmares? Madara says he's not good with people...

Natsume goes to the roof, holy...

The students are on the roof.

Why does he want to burn his name?

Natsume releases him from the book...

Sasada comes in and Shigure admits that she and Reiko are the only ones who did not judge him...Natsume points out Shigure tried to "connect [his] heart" to Sasada...
