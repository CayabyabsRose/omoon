Natsume's going through his grandma's stuff...

He mentions that her memories become his everytime he sees these flashbacks...

A kendama, a library book, and an old ticket.

His two friends (Nishimura and Kitamoto) are talking about how to eat kitsune udon...

Sasada is here too, and asks Natsume what the ticket is for.

Sasada calls him a terrible liar, and she wants to know where he's going...

Tanuma is here, and he distracts Sasada so Natsume could get on the bus...

Another youkai mistakes Natsume for his grandma. 

What a cute youkai!

Kiriganuma Prefecture.

Santo's name is now released. But Santo mentions Mikuri, who left him...

Natsume wants to go to Kiriganuma to find out more abt his grandma.

Now they walk along the tracks...and the sun's about to set, and Santo's eating a sour berry.

Oh no, attack of the trees! Why are they saying "unforgivable"?

They're after Santo, and Mikuri's still really angry...the trees are a telling sign.

Mikuri's malice is still influencing the area...

Mikuri's a YUGE catfish?

So Mikuri's name is bound by the book too, huh?

The book falls off of Natsume, and Santo has it!

Poor Santo...

That's a good trick by Madara, turn into a cat and turn back to get out, and he takes care of him...

So Mikuri's that small, huh?

So Santo gave his name easily to Reiko, huh?

Natsume's putting back the ticket in her box. Is she keeping a promise to someone? Or like what Madara said, did she forget her promise?

More tickets drop from the library book!

She might've kept them as souvenirs, or probably forgot her promises. Probably I'm guessing that she's not the sort of person to have closure on her life.

**Natsume:** "Friends, huh?"

Tanuma is back too! Natsume thanks him for yesterday. Tanuma is such a good friend. He comes off as this mysterious "cool" person but he's actually this good friend.

The ending song is so calming...
