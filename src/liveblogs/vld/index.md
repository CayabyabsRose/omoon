This is the main page for my liveblog of the [DreamWorks Animation][dw-anim] (owned by Comcast and NBC!) action-packed series, [*Voltron: Legendary Defender*][vld], which was released on June 10, 2016 on the streaming service Netflix. This show is a reboot of the classic 1984 show, [*Voltron*][vol], which itself was a mishmash of two Toei Animation-produced Japanese mecha shows *King of the Beasts GoLion* and *Dairugger XV*. *Voltron* (the 1984 show, not the 2016 show!) was also the first show to be released in stereo sound.

So how I first knew of this show was from this article on Angry Asian Man that was posted back in [March 2016][aam]. Another reason that convinced me to give this show a go were that the showrunners are *Avatar: The Last Airbender* alums Joaquim Dos Santos and Lauren Montgomery. Other reasons were because Steven Yeun is voicing someone on that show, and that one of the characters there sort of reminds me a bit of Kyon in terms of character design.

The watchthrough only covers seasons 2-4 of this entertaining show.
