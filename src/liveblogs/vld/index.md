This is the main page for my liveblog of the [DreamWorks Animation][dw-anim] (owned by Comcast and NBC!) title, [*Voltron: Legendary Defender*][vld], which was released on June 10, 2016 on the streaming service Netflix. This show is a reboot of the classic 1984 show, [*Voltron*][vol], which itself was a mishmash of two Toei Animation-produced Japanese mecha shows *King of the Beasts GoLion* and *Dairugger XV*. *Voltron* was also the first show to be released in stereo sound.

The watchthrough only covers seasons 2-4 of this entertaining show.
