Back at the village, we use the Gorgon Flower to restore the women from their statue state!

One of them gives us a Red Jewel!

The second woman's probably thanking us in her language, but Will can't understand her...

After restoring the third woman, Kara and Erik enter the hut.

Thank goodness for sign language!

**Kara:** "The animals have returned to the forest. They no longer prey on each other." Meaning the village can hunt for food again!

We speak to Kara again, who gives us more grim news...

Kara's not happy about the situation either.

Erik's news is even worse...

**Erik:** "A terrible story." Understatement of the year.

I save my progress here before talking to Kara again to set out.

We travel to the next town, following the labor trade route.
