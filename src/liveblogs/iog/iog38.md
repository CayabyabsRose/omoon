I spoiled myself a bit on how to take care of the bomb behind Erik since I was looking at a video on how to defeat the vampires.

Alright, here I go!

It takes a me a bit to get my bearings back...

I listen again to the vampires' banter toward each other, and off we go!

On the third try, I almost had the Vampire at half health!

I have to be careful of the vampires' combo attack: their big orb of light and lightning!

Still trucking on...

I take advantage of the vampires' delay at the start of our first fight by attacking the Vampire first!

I use up an Herb this time!

I finally finish off the more dangerous boss!

The Vampiress is easier. But she's more quicker!

Unfortunately, I'm low on health again and on time, and I lose!

Many more chances later...

This boss fight, on record, is one of the more challenging ones I've faced so far in any playthrough. Not least because of the setup of where I'm facing these vampires!

I find another Dark Space portal and switch to Freedan.

Knowing the vampires' attack patterns at this point, with Freedan, the Vampire easily falls!

The Vampiress, though quick as she is, is taken care of!

Freedan transforms back into Will, with exactly a minute to spare!

Oh god, another cut-the-wire moment...

I close my eyes and let randomness decide what happens...

The bomb's gone!

**Erik:** "Saved..."

Lilly apologizes to us for not helping out.

**Lilly:** "My legs gave out from fear. I couldn't move or make a sound. Up to now, I thought I was strong, but in a crisis..." She apologizes again. It's okay, Lilly.

I wonder why Erik would think Will is in disguise. Maybe it's because he saw Freedan?
