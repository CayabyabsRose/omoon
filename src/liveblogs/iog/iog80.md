We're flying again, yes!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TrnI12g.png" alt="plane ride" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

The journey there seems slightly long...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aOx9rRB.png" alt="tower of babel" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

...but we make it!

Neil's now flying over the tower.

Hopefully, we'll meet Olman soon. Will sends Neil his thank yous.

Erik misses Will already, and tells him to go back to South Cape after Will's done reuniting with his father.

**Will:** "Thank you. I'm glad we all made the trip together."<br/>
**Erik:** "On this trip, everyone found something. Lance met Lilly and found his lost father. Neil decided to take over his parents' company. Kara started to really live, and saw a world outside the castle. I'm going to excuse myself."

And Erik also has his personal character development too. Character development, yay!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/W8PPuDM.png" alt="bathroom" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Neil:** "Ha ha ha. Just like Erik."

But Neil notices something too.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RXpw9Aw.png" alt="kara said nothing" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Neil:** "I won't see Will for a long time. I'll say goodbye to him." And soon, for me, to this game too...

**Kara:** "Hmmm. Right..."

Neil sees Babel in the distance.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YGBjK5q.png" alt="ready parachute" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Here we go!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dCu71FU.png" alt="parachute jump" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Will:** "I hadn't been there in a year and a half..."

Now Will's back at the tower.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8MJI8lf.png" alt="tower of babel quiet" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HhUCf6x.png" alt="tower entrance" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Forward into the hallway, no monsters yet.

But we find golden statues of Freedan, and an empty pedestal.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HrI6jRi.png" alt="pedestal" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

So the flute was taken from that pedestal...

Our next obstacle is a spike pit, which Will easily sidles through...

The next passage is blocked by these lasers...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tDJpnPF.png" alt="laser blocked" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Will tries to go forward, but is zapped!

But something drops to the floor!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iQZTkzq.png" alt="crystal ring" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Ah, so this is how that King and the Jackal were tracking us, I'm guessing.

Or maybe not?

**Will:** "I thought it was a decoration, but it had been hidden there..."

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tCFB3xm.png" alt="crystal ring item" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

So the Ring that the King was looking for was hidden in the flute all along? Oh my god...

Who put that there?

I have Will equip the ring and we phase forward the lasers.

As we cross thru the hallway, someone's voice stops us...

It's Kara!

So she's going to stay with us till the end, huh?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LkVkHzA.png" alt="sorry" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Will asks why Kara came along to the tower, and without the Crystal Ring.

**Kara:** "Could that be the ring...Didn't you find it in the Incan Gold Ship?"

Will tells her the crystal on the ring is dark blue, not solid gold.

Plus, Kara has a ring with a light blue gem on it. Maybe that's why she was able to get in to the tower...

**Will:** "A light one and a dark one..."

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aFsyXhb.png" alt="don't leave" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Now Kara tags along for the journey! Lucky there's no enemies yet...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iS8Djyy.png" alt="kara tags along" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

On our way forward, we come across another sculpture of Freedan.

A blue flame is nearby and speaks to us about the comet.

"The light released from the comet has a profound effect on the growth of living things. When the star nears Earth's orbit, all living things experience a dramatic evolution..."

After passing by a Freedan statue, more blue flames appear, explaining the comet, and evolution.

The comet that's coming "is a demon of stars..."

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oJX6Abs.png" alt="beyond imagination" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

That sounds a bit foreboding...

We climb more stairs...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Eu5otHo.png" alt="time is different" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Meaning that a number of years outside might be minutes, or seconds, inside the tower? Oh dear...

"**You're not normal human beings, because you can live here.**" What did the flame mean by that?

The next flame warns us about the room next to it.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ntctdtx.png" alt="demons" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Looks like there's going to be more enemies to fight here!

On the right of the doorway, we see another Dark Space gate!

Beyond that is another Freedan statue, and the way up is barred by laser.

I save for now.
