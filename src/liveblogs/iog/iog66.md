Happy holidays!

Continuing Angkor Wat once more now that I've got my controller plugged in...

As a warm-up, I take care of a few monsters outside the temple before heading in.

The floating heads are still as dangerous as I remember them...

Back at the second passage, I have Will use a spin dash to climb up the ramp, and take on the purple floating head. It turns out the head doesn't float, but slides along the edges of the wall.

The more damage the head takes, the faster the head moves, like a pinball!

Down the stairs, we meet a rock giant and a sentinel mounted on the wall.

When I have Will attack the sentinel, it spits out green, slimy worms!

Another set of purple heads await. I take care of them one-by-one with caution.

Two mounted sentinels are blocking the way this time. After they're gone, a small duct to slide into opens up!

What a big mouth that wall has!

There's three more enemies in this area...

Another floating head! Aaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!

Two rock giants are also here...

But they're easy to take care of, as Will gets a defense boost!

Next area, seven monsters, and two of them are those purple sliding heads again!

There's only one way to go from here...

But as soon as Will lands, the floor drops!

Where are we?

The light begins to catch up...

**What are those things moving on the floor?**

Ignoring that, we find a nearby set of stairs and make our way back to solid flooring...

...to where two more floating heads wave around!

More floating and sliding heads later, and we end up in front of a smiling wall face...

There's one enemy left here, but where is that enemy?

I immediately notice the wall sentinel, and afterwards, win a defense boost, and the staircase back up!

Before going to the south pssage, I take care of a floating head and four more wall sentinels nearly taking Will's health completely!

But we get another health boost, increasing Will's health to 33!

Going east now, taking a look at the big hole that sent us down...

Next chamber, two rock giants jump and unleash the might of the ceiling on us, which we manage to avoid by sliding into the small crevice!

Knowing they're the greater danger, I take care of the rock giants here before going after the floating heads.

Another small space to slide into later, and we meet another set of rock giants!

Going after one, the second jumps down, causing a smattering of debris to crumble down!

Next, wall sentinels, and a chest containing an herb!

Speaking of which, I haven't used the herbs yet, now that I've got three of them...

I have Will go behind the place where the chest is, and use another Spin Dash to leap to the other side!

I'm guessing that this is not going to be good...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ctFbZjF.png" alt="two rock giants" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

...and I'm correct, as the giants make the ceiling rain!

But we get another strength boost after we clear the area.

We return to the entrance passage, and take care of the enemies on the other side of this temple.

The floating and sliding heads are still the trickiest monsters here.

Now for the wall sentinel that we couldnt reach when we entered...

We open some shortcut stairs after the wall sentinel's down! Plus, we get a strength boost for clearing the area!

Back to the village, where I have Gaia heal Will, and we continue onwards.

Hamlet's eaten already...
