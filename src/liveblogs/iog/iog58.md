I head back into Neil's parents' manor.

I take to the left stairway, up to a bedroom where a black haired girl in a blue dress is. Her name is Ann. She's probably Neil's sister. She tells us more bad news...

**Ann:** "He asked if anyone named Kara came into town. I shrank with fear when I saw his cold eyes."

She asks us if we should warn Kara. I think it over a bit before saying yes.

But, Ann's disappointed, as she's not too fond of Kara. Oh, come on!

I talk to Ann again, who says the same thing. This time, I choose the second decision, to keep that between ourselves. She giggles, knowing what to use against Kara. Oh god, what have I done?

She asks for an apple. I give her the free one from the merchant from last night's session.

Ann still wants another apple. I head back to the merchant's tables.

I repeat the process a third time.

Oh no... :frowning2:

**Ann:** "Good. As a present, I'll give you this jewel."

That's all the Red Jewels to collect in this town, I think.

Looks like Kara now has a rival...what have I done? All of that for a Red Jewel...

We go into the parlor, where Neil is talking with his folks.

His mother wants Neil to be the head of the company next.

I try to speak with Neil's father. No go.

Yeah, I can sort of relate a bit there, Neil.

Outside now, I double check around the town to see if there's anything I missed. 

The northeast exit leads to the lower quarter of town, I'm guessing.

Nothing. Back to the guestroom we go...also nothing. I save my session at this point, since we're going to be heading out to Mt. Kress next.

Here's a picture of Will running down from the ramps in town!
