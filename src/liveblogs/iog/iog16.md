Are we at the Golden Room now?

I have Will play the Wind Melody in the middle of the chamber.

What Gold Block?

I'm thinking we're going to face our first boss in this game soon...

A gold tile southeast of us is now glowing!

I have Will step on it.

Nothing's happening. 

I equip one of the Incan statues and try to place it on the glowing tile. Still nothing.

Maybe I'm too light. I go to Dark Space and switch to Freedan.

The gold tile's stopped glowing!

Back to Will again...

I have Will step on the tile and I have him do everything from twirling his flute to Dashing.

This is a clever puzzle...

What am I missing here?

But as soon as I typed the sentence above, the door to the next chamber opens!

We're back outside again!

I see another Dark Space portal west from our exit, and a pedestal with three columns surrounding it southwest of the door...

I climb the nearby ladder down, and notice a small recess on the mantel on top of the statue.

This must be where we can place one of the Incan statues...

Now for statue number two...

I hear a warbling sound. That's not good...

Into Dark Space, where I switch to Freedan. We talk to Gaia, who gives us advice on the boss coming up.

**Gaia:** "If you suffer damage, hide behind him."

Outside, I step on the pedestal...

As the wind blows, we leap to the other side of the cliff in a dash!

I'm semi-prepared for this moment.

Holy heck!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PTZKKI0.png" alt="first boss" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Unfortunately, I fail to finish him off, but I do have an idea on what to expect...

I have to attack his hands first, then his head.

Like the bosses in *Soul Blazer*, this boss does not mess around.

We're back outside, where Freedan notes the area to the boss looks familiar...

Then we lose our second life!

I switch back to Will, since he's a smaller target than Freedan is...

I still lose...

I sort of like this little detail below. Will mentions that he might've been dreaming of trying to finish off the boss earlier. It sort of gives an in-story justification of a "lost" life.
