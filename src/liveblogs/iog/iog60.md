The enemies are back again!

Lucky I'm now at full health as I clear the area once more!

The second area's still pretty tough to get through, though, not least because of the floating golden skull heads.

Now that's an unusual sight...

I face off against the floating flute flame summoners again, taking care of both of them.

And now I'm stuck!

I wander around the maze of plant stalks a little bit. I attempt to perform a spin dash near a raised vine next, but I'm trying to remember how to do one...

Looking back on my comments on how to perform the Spin Dash, I have Will start.

It takes me one or two tries, but I make it!

While trying to take a screenshot of my progress, I accidentally shut down the game again!!!

***Aside:*** I pushed Select and Start instead of Select and the triangle button to bring up the menu to take pics!

Here we go again...

I finally make it this time!

It looks like our old friend, the dark knight, has come to help us!

I record our progress here and take a break before continuing on...

Here we go! I don the role of Freedan this time.

I take care of the flutist and the "cross" formation of enemies ahead, winning a defense boost!

Next area, there's a chest with 14 more enemies...

Using the east stalk, I leap forward and land in the middle of a nest of spiders and skull heads!

I make my way around the area, looking for enemies.

Holy heck, Freedan's Dark Friar power looks different this time! The fireballs spiral away instead of shooting forward.

I try to repeat that effect on other enemies, but no good.

As a reward for clearing the area, Freedan's health has now gone up to 29!

The chest in this area's hard to reach...

I go east, and turn back.

Taking the west path past the red caps...

Oh my god...this game is not messing around this time...

Let's hope this game does **not** have 99 enemies in the later dungeons.

Taking the middle path west leads to another path blocked by a giant mushroom.

The giant mushrooms here make this plant maze a bit of a walk, but not frustrating, since Freedan's power makes up for it.

I perform the powerful version of the Dark Friar again! It turns out I needed to keep charging for a certain period of time...

There's a lot of floating skull heads in this area...

I end up spamming the poweful version of the Dark Friar in front of a line of skull heads!

My reward is another health boost! I'm now at 30!

Now let's see what's in this chest...

**Mushroom Drops**? Hmmm...

I try using this on the nearby giant mushrooms, but nothing's happening.

Reading the drops' use from the menu, it seems they only work on empty stalks, like this one in the screenshot below.

The stalks grow into a bridge for us to cross!

I save my session for tonight since I'm running out of power to type here...
