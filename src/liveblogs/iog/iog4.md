As soon as we head for home, an unusual sight greets us!

**Will:** "But why is there a pig in my house?" Yeah, why is there a pig? Unless...oh no...I hope that's not Will's grandma...

As soon as I have Will head upstairs, the pig goes near Will and pushes him to the dining room.

Someone comes down. It's the runaway princess **Kara**, I'm guessing! And that's her pig Hamlet!

Kara asks if this is Will's house, and criticizes him for being "a lil' shabby." Will says the same thing I'm thinking.

Hee...

Kara asks where Will's parents are. They're not here.

She goes to the photo hanging on the kitchen. She's asking the same question I asked last session: If that photo taken was of Will's parents.

How did she know about him?

**Kara:** "Are you sad? ...No? I'd be sad if it were me. I'm sorry..."

Kara looks around and asks if there's a piano around the house. None. Will mentions Grandma Grandma having a "great" singing voice, though.

Kara's aware of that.

I head upstairs.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vT3lGbY.png" alt="lola lola sings opera" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Will's grandma sings opera!?

But dinner's not ready.

**Bill:** "Oh my, I haven't sung like this in a long time."

Grandpa Bill sings opera too?!

**Bill:** "Your grandmother [...] used to be a singer. I fell in love with her voice. That's why I married her." Awww...

Grandma Grandma chuckles a bit.

Kara?

But then...

"**A scream from downstairs!**"

Oh no...

Two soldiers now surround Kara...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xF2JXzn.png" alt="princess" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Kara denies knowing them. But the soldiers tell her that they'll be charged with death if they don't bring her back to the castle. Kara don't care.

**Soldier:** "Do you think I have nothing better to do than chase you down? I must take you home. It's the King's orders!"

They drag her away...no...

Kara now reveals herself to Will...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oNmo9cO.png" alt="i'm the princess" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Kara:** "**I'm sorry I lied to you. I'm King Edward's daughter, Kara. Will. I feel as though we've met before, as if we were good friends.**"

Grandma Grandma and Grandpa Bill go to the table.

Grandpa Bill thinks she was "playing a practical joke" on Will.

But Grandma Grandma tells us something about Edward Castle.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eYlvUlC.png" alt="big viaduct" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

She also tells us Grandpa Bill designed the viaduct in the castle! Oh my god! Even Will's surprised by that! Is she subtly asking us to go after her soon?

**Bill:** "I used to be an architect."

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DToK73s.png" alt="prison under castle" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Oh my god...

**Bill:** "It's built like a maze to keep the prisoners from escaping. I feel bad that I built a prison where people disappear and are never heard from again."

Grandma Grandma brushes that aside and gets dinner ready, saying she has pie prepped upstairs.

Grandpa Bill mentions to Will about Grandma's dinner meals getting "strange." He knows there's something on Grandma's mind...

At least I can still go outside and save my session!
