Back to another jail cell...

***Aside:*** Counting my **Berseria** and **Mana** playthroughs, this is the fourth time a main character's in prison.

**Will:** "I wonder why I have to suffer so...I wonder what will become of me now."

Now we have to find an escape route...but how?

Will notices a ball-and-chain nearby. But who got free?

I'm still guessing the King and Queen are probably manipulated by some unknown force. I mean, why would they hire a hunter, and then lock Will up in a jail cell for not having a ring for?

I run and walk around the cell. Nothing.

**Will:** "These prisoners must have been encouraged by any sign of life..."

After a bit of wandering, we hear some soldiers talking...

...about bread and water.

A loaf drops down from the ceiling.

Poor Will...

"**For some reason, he really misses Grandma's creative cuisine...**"

How do we get out of here?

**Will:** "It pains me to think of the prisoners' feelings, not knowing what they should do..."

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5PJTRFC.png" alt="will" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Whoa, what? The flute can talk?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zR3ACC1.png" alt="this is your father" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Flute:** "**This is your father.**"

**Huh?!**

The flute, or the father speaking through it, compliments his son. He even asks about Grandma's snail pie!

**Will:** "Uh, sure Dad! Where are you?!"

Olman doesn't want to give away his location. Oh my god...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fqNAJrO.png" alt="i have something to ask" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Now what should I decide here?

I go with the first choice.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/347AKfr.png" alt="save me" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

So Will's father's trapped somewhere...

He tells us to look at the "left-hand wall" in the cell.

Something drops from the wall!

We get five of something!

The flute asks us about any news from Grandpa Bill, and mentions the stone from the wall has a "secret." Hopefully, it can take us out...

But the flute has more warnings to give us...

Oh boy...

**Will:** "Do I have to...?"

Will's question is the same as mine.

The flute tells us about a "stone [our] enemy left." Enemy?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YnaB8TZ.png" alt="crystal is contained" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Flute:** "That power will prove to be your ally..."

He tells us of our next mission.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LoANkeB.png" alt="mystic statues" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

What are the Mystic Statues?

**Flute:** "The closer you get to the Crystal, the stronger the evil power will be..."

Our next destination is to go to the **Incan Ruins**.

I hear an oink from somewhere...

I hope the Princess comes to save us...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6FKvIm0.png" alt="hamlet?" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Will asks if that's Hamlet. I'm guessing he is! There's a key and a note the pig's carrying! Yes, the Princess saved us!

We read the note.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CPKQA0M.png" alt="sorry in prison" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

"It's terrible what my father has done, but hear what I have to say. I too am a prisonerâ€”in a prison of silk and gold. **But tonight I will leave the castle forever. You also will be free.**"

Thank you, Princess. :slight_smile:

I equip the key and open the door...

I see another portal to Dark Space in an empty cell, where Gaia gives out combat advice. So we are going to fight soon.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/w8QONmx.png" alt="gaia says jewel get after enemies gone" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

The start button, Gaia says, tells us where nearby enemies are.

I have a feeling that this might be a trap of sorts, doing this fetch quest. I'm worried that it might **not** be Will's father speaking through the flute at all...
