I visit Erik back at the inn, where the gang's almost back together again!

Poor Erik...

**Erik:** "My tears have all been cried..."

Lilly thinks that Lance should stay at the inn until he remembers everything.

Our next stop is the diamond mine...

Will walks a long ways southeast of the continent, and into a peak.

Here we are! In another dungeon we go...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ugMdaZo.png" alt="diamond mine" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Before heading in, Will monologues again.

"**The Diamond Mine was as quiet as a tomb. A chill ran down Will's spine when he heard the screams from the back of the cave.**"

I strike at the lizardman first! Then the lizard creature unleashes their whip!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RI20XJj.png" alt="lizard fight" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

We swiftly dodge and take care of him.

Up ahead, a burrowing worm pops out of the ground!

More lizards and worms are on patrol as we continue our way in the mine!

As a reward for clearing the room, Will gets a health boost! Now Will's health is up to 14!

In the next room, after taking care of a lizardman, I have Will read a sign. The sign shows an elevator entrance south of the sign.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oIKzwT8.png" alt="sign to elevator door" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

The elevator is locked, though.

There's one laborer shackled to a chain ball in the mine here...time to free him!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/H5YrMO0.png" alt="lizard and laborer" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

After taking care of the lizardman, I free the laborer! The laborer gives us more info about the mine.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/t8XKPHB.png" alt="eight people to rescue" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

It turns out this is another "rescue the people from the mines" quest.

Checking the pause screen, there's 21 enemies left in this shaft.

Ahead, I meet a one-eyed floating creature!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XCKcnAu.png" alt="gorgon" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

The creature can shoot beams from their eye, and turn into stone!

I continue to clear the shaft of lizardpeople and gorgons here! I also need to watch Will's health here!

Taking care of a nearby worm, we open up the gorgon duo's pen!

More monsters later, I'm nearly low on health, but I'm saved by a health pickup dropped by a worm!

I also free the laborer from his chains when trying to take care of the reptilian patroller guarding him!

Talking to the laborer, he gives us a secret.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YMoichl.png" alt="secret passage" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Hmmm...a secret passage...

He tells us that in order to find it, we need to watch for a breeze blowing through the cracks in the wall. I need to watch carefully at Will's animation. If his hair is blowing in front of a wall, then we've found the passage.

Heading south, more monsters to take care of! Plus, I get an herb from a chest, yes!

I continue clearing out the horde of monsters in the shaft...

Up the stairs we go to a higher part of the shaft, where I activate a button nearby. Down south, another button!

The worms guarding it nearly take down Will's health...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8PPT1KW.png" alt="another button" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

West, a lizardman's watching over the last button.

I take care of him, gaining another boost!

Up north, I activate the last button, and open the trapdoor leading deeper into the mine.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0RSFpdU.png" alt="trapdoor open" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Six enemies here in this shaft...

I circle this shaft and descend.

After finishing off the enemies here, I gain access to another Dark Space portal!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rBj5nSs.png" alt="dark space portal" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Looks like it's still Freedan here.

I recover and save before turning into Freedan and heading out again.

In the next shaft, I notice a long rope above us.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/L1fs0kn.png" alt="long rope" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

That must be the mine's delivery system.

Ahead, we come across two ramps...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nLIDyt6.png" alt="two ramps" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

I have Freedan climb the stairs and run down to get to the ledge across.

I descend again and take care of more creatures here...

There's only one enemy left, but they're unreachable for now.

In the next room, more gorgons!

One opens the passage forward.

This passage is cramped with tons of fencing and enemies!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JFKVA1J.png" alt="cramped fences" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Ahead, another Dark Space portal awaits us! This feels a bit too easy here...

I recover and change back to Will...

The second laborer we freed earlier mentioned a secret room in the mine. Since Will's hair is blowing here, this means...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GshRVov.png" alt="secret wall" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

After a dash, we open the room!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TWUVZKh.png" alt="room open" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Ahead, there's another Dark Space portal. My goodness, this game's getting generous with us!

At Freedan's statue, something is glowing in front of him...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WR59nHx.png" alt="statue glowing" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Looks like Freedan has a new power: **Dark Friar!**

Gaia explains what **Dark Friar** is, and how Freedan can use the power.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/s45wxP7.png" alt="dark friar" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

We talk to Gaia again, who mentions that the **Dark Friar** is a long range attack.

I demo the new power, where Freedan's aura glows red. Once I let go, a fireball comes out!

Going back to the unreachable enemy, it takes me a few tries to charge the power!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7nvhJ7y.png" alt="facing unreachable enemy" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Defeating the enemy breaks the fence blocking the ramp!

I have Freedan start on a dash down the ramp...

We make it!

Inside the upper room, we free a third laborer, who tells us more laborers were forced to work in the deeper parts of the mine. He gives us a key that opens the elevator!

I go back to Gaia and save at this point.

I wonder if we're going to find Seth here?
