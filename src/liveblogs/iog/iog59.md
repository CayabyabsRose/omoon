Let's see what's in that mountain...

On the map, **Mt. Kress** is called **Mt. Temple**.

The full name of the dungeon is called **Mountain Temple**, with more enemies and vines to be had...

**Will:** "There's a strange place at the summit of Mt. Kress. There are mushrooms many times bigger than me, and plant stalks are scattered around."

I take care of the floating skull heads here.

Checking the map, there's 10 enemies in this area.

Walking north now. The giant mushrooms' faces look cute...

Up north, we see a spider crawling on top of a giant red cap!

It's using its web to reach us!

There's two more of its friends, and a floating skull head as reinforcements!

One of the spiders shoots out a purple sludge! I manage to take care of it.

I clear out the rest of the area and win a strength boost!

Remembering something I read from a map of Watermia online, I go back to meet up with Lance and Lilly.

We use the Kruk again to cross the desert!

Up to Luke the fisherman's house, where Lance gives us an update.

**Lance:** (to Will) "Now [me and my father] can talk. I hope you get to see your father soon."

As a reward, he gives us a Red Jewel that he picked up from his father's things!

Lilly's news is definitely important.

She doesn't believe those "rumors" though.

Now we have plenty of places to visit from Watermia!

But, in order to go to the Mountain Temple again, we have to cross through Euro City because of the desert.

And the enemies are back again!

Proceeding to the next area now...

Yikes!

I also send the Red Jewel away to the Jeweler before heading south and taking care of more floating skull heads.

A golden skull head? Oh no...

The head shakes and shoots blue fire as a counterattack!

We encounter another golden skull head, and I realize that the head also attacks when it sees us, not just as a counter...

The save point is on top of a red cap...how to get there?

Using a ramp made of vines, Will runs all the way down into the clump of red caps!

Now that's an enemy I haven't seen before...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4Myj3mP.png" alt="new enemy" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

They surround themselves with small, dancing blue flames as their attack pattern...

Seeing my health is low, I avoid the floating fire flutist...

I use up an apple, with Will praising the fresh tastiness of the apple. It only heals 1 HP...

We run back to Euro City, and rest on Gaia's perch in the Dark Space there.
