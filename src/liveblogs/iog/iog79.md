We return to the hieroglyph room, where another surprise awaits us!

It's Olman again! Or is it?

Will asks if that's his father talking.

**Flute:** "I'm at the tower now. Bring the five Mystic Statues to the tower. The statues you've collected hold the key to the fate of humanity. Will...Hurry...The comet is approaching..."

**Will:** "...I was told to go to the Tower of Babel, but that little island..."

But Kara gives us more good news: Neil's built another plane!

We're back at the Desert Village, at the house where Neil's staying.

I save before talking to Neil.

Neil's not too comfortable about Will going to the tower.

But Neil doesn't stop Will, since he knows Will's determined to see his father.

**Neil:** "OK. I'll take Will to the Tower of Babel, then take Kara and Erik to South Cape."

I'll take your word for that, Neil.
