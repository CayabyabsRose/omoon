Let's start this again...

I use Freedan again to fight the boss.

Knowing what to attack is easy, it's the bouncing fireball diamond and the line of fireballs I have to watch out for...

I lose to the boss again!

I switch to Will this time, since he's a smaller target against the boss's fireballs!

It takes longer, but I manage to get the upper hand against the boss temporarily. I don't defeat him, but I manage to survive two of his laser beam attacks!

I have to avoid the north end behind the boss, because that's where I'm vulnerable to the row of fireballs...

After the boss's forehead and eyes glow purple, that's when he can be attacked...

The boss's health is huge!

I try fighting him using Freedan again. Even when the boss's main health isn't touched, he can still fire his beam at us! Probably this only happens when his hands are gone...

His health's now down to half, but I still fall...

On my sixth try, I realize I can take advantage of Freedan's longer reach against the boss.

After (I think?) my seventh try, the fireworks happen!

Now that the boss is finished, Freedan's health is restored, and Freedan turns back into Will!

I wonder where that door north leads to?

Going into the long hallway, we come across a wide hole...

Will jumps down into the darkness below...
