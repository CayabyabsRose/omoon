Down the stairs we go...

I learn from a guy outside I can run by tapping the control pad twice and holding it.

I talk to a few people. One tells me not to go north where the demons are.

A traveling weapons peddler is nearby, and we talk to him.

**Adultist!** *\*hiss\**

I head inside the building, which is Will's place.

***Aside:*** For any Tagalog speakers here, Will's actually calling his grandmother "Grandma" twice.

I wander around town a bit. Lots of people to talk to...

One person's cooking in a pot since he has no stove.

Outside, three girls are playing red light, green light.

We go down the stairs to Erik's house.

Erik's mom is resting her back with a steam solution.

Erik's dad thinks everyone is jealous because they live in a big house. They've lived in South Cape the longest, he adds.

I head outside and down to the port.

That sounds a bit ominous...

A woman tells us she feels sorry for Seth. Poor Seth...his parents fight every day...

Opening the door, a pot is thrown above Will's head!

Will shakes his head.

I go next door to Lance's house.

The narration from Will makes the game feel a bit like a movie.

Poor Will...

I head down the dock and into a boarded-up tunnel, or, Will and friends' hideout.

"**Usually, when lessons are over, they gathered there to talk and play games until sundown.**"

I leave the cave and jump off the ledge in front of the school entrance!

A **Jeweler Gem?**

I ask for an explanation for what he does.

**Jeweler Gem:** "I am a famous master of disguises. If you saw me in another town, you wouldn't know me."

He can give us things in exchange for **Red Jewels**.

Here's what he can give away: **Herb**, **Defense Force**, **Life Force**, **Strength**, **Psycho Power**, **Dark Power**, and "[his] secrets."

I jump off and go inside Seth's house.

:frowning2:

After a very quick chat, I leave immediately!

I decide to head back to the school roof, into Gaia's domain, and save here for tonight.
