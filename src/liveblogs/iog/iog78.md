After transforming into Shadow again, I have them go back to the hieroglyph chamber.

The Jackal's now nothing but a skeleton...

I have Shadow insert the last tablet onto the wall.

Our next destination is beyond this portal.

The prompt tells me: "The mummified queen of the Pyramid appears," meaning it's time for another boss!

The boss music starts playing!

Now where is Her Majesty?

There's now a whole lot of shaking and rumbling going on as we use one of the portals to travel up to the queen's perch.

After striking the queen, she vanishes into tiny specters!

She uses her specters to divide and conquer us, but I have Shadow sink into the floor to prevent that from happening!

The queen's now green, literally!

She changes color everytime she turns back...

The specters' attack patterns have now changed! They're spinning around the room this time!

I finally realize that when she splits into specters and does her circle dance around the room, she's making illusions of herself! I have to find the real ghost from the illusions!

Soon after, we bring down the queen of the Pyramid!

The fifth Mystic Statue is ours! Finally!

So the final Mystic Statue must be at...
