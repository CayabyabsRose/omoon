Making our way back to the depths of the tunnel to Ishtar's studio!

This part of the cavern's getting darker...

What's worse, the enemies are camouflaged by the darkness!

I got away with a few hits and a strength boost!

The next passage isn't as dark anymore!

It's a dead end here...

But by pressing the A button in the right spot, Will notices something!

**Will:** "I found a hidden pass!"

The passageway opens!

There's a rod or a marker lodged into the ground, a skull as its pommel!

As a greeting, it throws fireballs on its left and right sides!

More creatures here again...

After taking care of another eyeless serpent, we see a small crevice west of the passage...

...and find a chest with a Red Jewel inside!

It takes me a few tries to slide Will out of the room.

The passage downstairs leads us to a fiercely blowing Wind Tunnel!

It takes Will sprinting to move forward...

I manage to win a health boost in this breezy chamber...

Finally!

The next room has a whole lineup of swoopers, monsters, and Angel statues waiting for us.

At the end of the hallway is another small crevice to slide into.

The room's completely silent save for a soft whirring noise...

Heading east, the noise gets louder. I'm guessing we're almost there...

Another dead end.

I go to the source of the whirring sound...

From the wind blowing at Will's hair, it seems we've found the entrance to Ishtar's studio.
