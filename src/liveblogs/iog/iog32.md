Back to the deeper parts of the palace, the monsters have resurrected!

Going to the eastern stairway, I'm in a room in front of three coffins...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/l0fCcny.png" alt="coffins" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

I examine each one from left to right.

On the leftmost coffin, Lilly asks if there's a hole in this one, and flies to examine the coffin herself. She goes in, and opens it!

She found something in there!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/p7KPC9X.png" alt="strange stone" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

It's the **Purification Stone!**

I examine the second coffin, letting Lilly have a look.

**Lilly:** "Strange...there's a key fastened inside this coffin. No wonder it didn't open."

The third coffin's empty. It must be for the vampire that got out...

Heading down and to the western passage, a gray slime drops down from the ceiling! There's a lot of slimes in this palace!

I have Will go to the end of the corridor, where two more gray slimes drop!

up the stairway we go...

...where we get another Red Jewel inside!

I go down the middle stairway and head west...

...to a room where both Lance and Neil are! Or rather, their ghosts!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SeFMsam.png" alt="lance & neil ghost" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Lance is groaning like a zombie...so's Neil.

And the monsters have regenerated!

Back outside, I come across one blue slime and a gray slime parade!

In the far right stairway, we're now in a room covered with vines with a pool of that looks like a gray void in the center!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GYxF9uR.png" alt="fountain" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Lilly:** "Could there be a connection between this and the rock...?"

I decide to take care of the enemies here first before thinking about using the Stone of Purification in this pool...

I manage to take care of every enemy but five invisible ones above before going back to the fountain.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IFiUPeB.png" alt="massive fountain" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Nothing happening here, so I have Will move to the north end of the fountain.

"**The stone began to glow, then disappeared into the spring.**"

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AAFs3GI.png" alt="stone rises" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

I don't know if this is a good sign or not...

Flashes of light...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QU6pRvo.png" alt="fountain pure" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

The water in the fountain's turned pure again...

Back upstairs, the map isn't showing up anymore when I pause! More proof that everything's okay is that there's people now!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CV3Zmql.png" alt="demon changed" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Lilly:** "What!? All the demons we saw before were human beings...?"

So the skeletons in the upper chambers of the palace were people? Oh my god!

A blue haired woman feels relieved to be freed from being a demon, saying that "death is terrifying!"

I go west to see if Lance and Neil are alive...

They're gone...

Upstairs, there's a trader who was going to be carted off to prison for trafficking people, but was given away to the vampire instead!

Another man implies the vampire might be a woman...the blue-haired woman next to him says the vampire was a "nice guy!" It's the last time she'll trust men.

One trader upstairs in the coffin room thinks that vampire slept in one of the coffins...

A man says there are **two** vampires who live in the palace!

He explains their process of luring people into the palace. They turn their victims into demons, and use them for labor! Eeee....

Another woman gives us more info about the vampiric duo.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QCXTHhl.png" alt="vampires looking" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Are they trying to look for the third Mystic Statue, or do they have the statue?

I wonder, did the vampires take Lance, Neil, Erik, and Kara?

From another woman, we learn that they don't have the statue yet.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/57kY69y.png" alt="mystic statue in mu" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

That brings up the question: **Why do the vampires need the statue for?**

At the dead end room, we see a man at the corner, who stole the key from one of the vampires!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9TsJtDV.png" alt="key get" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Yes!!!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DSbwTie.png" alt="passage to mu top floor" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

So that means the locked door where Will first woke up leads to the mainland.

A couple in one of the floors of the palace wonders what they'll do now since they're stuck in the underwater palace. The woman thinks of taking over the palace as their home.

Erik's gone...

At the floor where the Dark Space portal is, Kara's also missing...

I save before opening the door to **Mu Tunnel**.
