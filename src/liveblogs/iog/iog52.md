Down to the depths of the wall we go!

As we land on the sand, something rises: another sandworm! It moves away quickly!

My goodness, that boss is very fast!

Another attack's coming: sand cannonballs! No, they're eggs!

A good strategy would be to attack the sandworm when she's laying her eggs!

And now she's leaping to and from the sand in an arc, as her "egg" is dashing away!

I sort of manage to get the hang of this boss.

We eventually take care of her!

It turns out this boss is the **Sand Fanger**, the worm rumored to cure any disease!

Four Mystic Statues now!

Now how are we going to get out of here?

I notice a ladder at the right end of the sand pit, and climb back up the wall!

Compared to the vampires, at least this boss was easy!
