With Kruks mounted, we set off to the northwest for the city of Euro!

Entering the city, the place looks as lively as the Imperial cities (Northtown and Southtown, I think?) in *Secret of Mana*...

The camera pans west, glossing over the sights of Euro, where many green and blue haired people walk about.

**Will:** "We crossed the desert and finally arrived in the village of Euro. Euro was a bustling city, larger than I had imagined."

There's a long row of merchants selling their wares at a long street.

So that means Will is well-connected indeed...

The camera stops at a museum-like building. This is probably Neil's parents' manor.

**Will:** "Neil hadn't been there for three years. His parents welcomed him home. They set off fireworks. There were dancers. It looked like a festival had started [...] We were shown to the guest room."

Inside the house now, where background music from Edward's Castle plays. The music's nice for vast explorations.

**Neil:** "Well, make yourself at home. I want to talk to my parents. It's been three years."

Erik's worried about getting lost in the manor since he doesn't know where the bathroom is.

Karaâ€™s amazed at the size of the house.

**Kara:** "...The townspeople seem to be richer than the King..."

This makes me wonder, how did Neil's folks attain their wealth? Exploitation of other people?

We leave for the hallway of the manor.

The place is vast but looks comfy to live in. The warmth of the house can be felt even in the hallway.

Where to next?

I decide to cheat a bit and look at a map of the city this time since I'm in a rush to find a Dark Space portal and stop my session for tonight.

The portal's inside a small house southeast of the city.

My goodness, Neil's parents' house looks like a holy chapel of sorts!

There's a line outside to go into a building...

Entering the door next to the long line, I get pushed out by a clerk saying that I entered an exit!

My god, what a large city!

I check the online map again. The portal's on the second floor of the first house I entered.
