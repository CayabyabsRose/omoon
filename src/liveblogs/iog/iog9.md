I have Will transform into Freedan and continue onwards in the dungeon!

Now we meet the enemy that finished us off last time!

I make careful work of the skeleton, staying away from his range as best as possible.

Once I take care of the floating skull, the pathway forward is clear!

Now for the remaining enemies in this area...

...and I win a Defense Boost!

Unfortunately, as Freedan, I can't play Grandma's melody, as he doesn't have a flute to play.

I organize the Red Jewels before proceeding back to Dark Space, to have Gaia heal us, and save at this point.

Into the next doorway, where I'm in a castle hallway. A prompt tells us something:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KtN2056.png" alt="goodbye freedan" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

So once all the enemies are taken care of, it's goodbye, Freedan...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/d4aUbCS.png" alt="freedan kneels" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

...and Freedan kneels down, turning back into Will!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TFn5nec.png" alt="back as will" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Nothing in the barrels to pick up.

Ahead, we see someone...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hTYJzJ0.png" alt="who is this?" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Could this person be friend or foe?

<a name="2"></a>

We walk towards the person, it's a girl!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BBrdpaw.png" alt="you change chg shape" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

So she can also change form as well, huh? She introduces herself.

**Lilly:** "**I'm Lilly. An Itory girl protected by the Flower Spirit.**"

By the color of the font, this girl was the fairy, or the dandelion, we hit while moving the statue! She might've also been the one who helped us open the door in the button puzzle!

But she has other questions to ask Will...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GNY1YN5.png" alt="how do you knwo abt melody?" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Will explains about his Grandma teaching him that melody.

Lilly mentions she had her pie. Grandma Grandma, always the experimental chef...

Will's in shock that Lilly knew his Grandma!

**Lilly:** "Actually, she asked me to rescue you!" **What?**

We hear a warping noise...

That's a call from the Elder of Itory. Lilly leaves to meet him. She greets Will goodbye.

Lilly turns back into a flower and flutters away...

Back at Edward's Castle again...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2IzBbRc.png" alt="back in celler" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

By the darker shade of the castle walls, it's nighttime...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BmRrT7K.png" alt="more patrols" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

More patrols, dangit!

There's a maid on the second floor, but she doesn't stop us. I'm betting she knows there's something different with the King.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0pPWjXo.png" alt="take kara" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

The romantic couple's still hanging out before the tower.

Looking at the scenery at the wall, it's pretty nice at night!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GaJLXA4.png" alt="nice scenery" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

But I make it to the Princess's room, where the patrolman guarding the room is sleeping...

The Princess is overjoyed to see us!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/D9LIDMU.png" alt="of course you've come" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Kara reveals the guard's nickname. Hee...

**Kara:** "Was the guard asleep outside? His nickname is 'Old Snorehead.' Sleeping again."

Will mentions Hamlet with Kara.

Kara introduces her pig to Will. She calls Hamlet "cute." She also mentions another quality of Hamlet's.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3aaWXsZ.png" alt="pig power" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

"Pig power"?

**Kara:** "Please, take me out of here!" Will do.

Together, with our new ally, we make our way downstairs.

I notice that whenever I have a Red Jewel equipped and I use it, they go straight to the Jeweler Gem!

I do the same with the second Red Jewel.

So Kara has no stats...

As soon as we get down, I find a typo of Kara's name as Kara stops us...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kqrudEK.png" alt="karen" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

She asks us to come along to the cellar to get some food.

We do so, and inside an open barrel, we find more food.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ABLEn6i.png" alt="large leg of yak" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

I've never tasted yak before...I wonder how large the roast yak leg is?

Kara tells us we should head out asap.

I feel like we need to bring more food...the leg of yak might not be enough.

We finally make it back to the front doors again...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kfwcAcv.png" alt="at last we leave" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Kara suggests going back to South Cape to visit Grandma Grandma and Grandpa Bill.
