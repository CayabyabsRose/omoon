Heading into Rofsky and Erasquez's house, and Rofsky mentions a "dispute" over the teapot from the Mountain Temple.

Mostly, it's about the tears inside the teapot came from. Rofsky mentions the tears "save people," Erasquez thinks the tears "reflect [one's] true form."

Back at the manor, Neil bids us farewell.

Kara decides to go to Angkor Wat.

So now it's Kara, Hamlet, Erik, and Will left in the expedition...

But the way to get into Angkor Wat is by heading into the Natives' Village...

As we enter, the area's beginning to swirl. It's a heat wave in this area, even though there's lush greenery here. We're probably in humid climes...

**Erik:** "I see the world tilted, my eyes blurred..."

Will decides that the village is our rest stop.

As Kara and Erik walk uphill to the village, we notice a skeleton around the square!

**Will:** "They're not weathered yet... Only recently bleached white." This person must have recently passed on.

Going east and around a corner, I notice a Dark Space portal!

Kara, Hamlet, and Erik stop before a cabin...

I check the cabin next door...

Oh my god...

So Sam wasn't kidding about what happened to his village...

Checking the map, it seems that we are in what happens to be the game's equivalent of Asia right now.

Examining the place, we find a Red Jewel inside a jar on the south end of the room!

I talk to Kara who also notices the emptiness of the village too.

**Kara:** "Should we go into the houses?"

The party enters the cabin.

The place is empty.

**Kara:** "No one here... The village looks abandoned."

Erik decides to stay here for the night.

Talking to Kara, we rest up.

"**A long time passes...**"

Uh oh, this is not good...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BJRqoOX.png" alt="men come in" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

The men enter the cabin!

Will grunts in his sleep, thinking it's Hamlet bothering him...

Kara tells Will not to "be so noisy."

Kara sees the men and jumps in fright!

Punching sounds...

Now Will, Kara, and Erik are tied up, with Hamlet about to be a sacrifice!

I hate this part of the game...

How will they escape?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/q1F78T3.png" alt="they seem hungry" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

They're also desperate as well. The girls are turned into statues, and most of the village is nearly empty.

Kara notices the children in the right of the bonfire, who have Hamlet, look "upset," or sad.

Will mentions Sam back in Freejia, who pointed out how desperately hungry the villagers are...

Kara soon realizes why there are skeletons in the village.

Oh my god.

**Erik:** "Oh, no! We'll be next!!"

Hamlet approaches the fire...no Hamlet!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zozROhn.png" alt="hamlet approach" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

But instead he goes to Kara.

**Kara:** "Hamlet...Why such a sad look?"

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eiT5Uiy.png" alt="no hamlet" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Hamlet knows he's going to be food soon... :frowning2:

He runs headfirst into the bonfire!!!

Kara screams for her pet pig as Hamlet grunts...

**Kara:** "Hamlet!! **Hamlet!!**"<br/>
**Will:** "Hamlet... Why?"

<a href="https://youtu.be/oyLJxUahjMY">A new theme plays...</a> this one gives me a bit of the chills hearing it...

Erik quotes Shakespeare.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SNEJqUA.png" alt="to eat or not to eat" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

That is definitely a question. But, since the villagers are starving...

Kara sobs for Hamlet... :frowning2:

Then a poof of smoke, and a ghost of a woman appears above the roasted Hamlet!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xYDstKB.png" alt="woman spirit" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

The spirit speaks to the trio.

"**Listen, everyone. It was Hamlet's wish to be food for these people.**"

So Hamlet knew that the villagers were very hungry...

"**One baby pig could save many villagers.**"

Will notices who the ghost is: Will's mother!

"**Will... and everyone in this place...**"

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VhJK0lo.png" alt="darkness approaches" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

"**You must combine your strength to save the planet.**"

She tells Will to find the remaining Mystic Statues and to head directly to the **Tower of Babel**, where his father is.

She releases them from their binds!

We'll miss you, Hamlet...even though I almost forgot about you...
