Before heading into the manor, I decide to explore all of the city, since there's plenty of secret hiding places here.

Downstairs, a citizen mentions how the Roleks have made Euro into a bustling place to visit, noticing "something behind the success."

A woman in the street also tells us there are many secret alleyways "in between houses" here.

We talk to another woman, who mentions two people residing in a nearby house.

Rofsky and Erasquez?

She tells us that they always argue. Creative differences at work?

Before turning a corner in a back alley, by pressing B, I find another Red Jewel!

After seeing where the alley leads to, behind a stall at merchant's row, we move on over to the next street.

What is that guy doing?

We enter in his house. It's the Jeweler!

So far, we only need one more Red Jewel for another prize!

In the next house over, twins live here.

**Twin:** "Big mushrooms and plants grow in circles like a maze. Water from the mushrooms drips onto broken stems. New growth sprouts up, forming a path." This might be important...

The other twin notes the drops from the mushrooms surround the temple in Mt. Kress.
