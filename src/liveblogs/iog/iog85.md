I applaud when Moto Hagio's name showed up...and Seth tries to keep up with Erik and Lance, but can't...

Erik and Lance eventually fall behind.

Kara enters the view, jumping up and down, then following Will.

Lilly turns from a dandelion into a girl, and follows the rest of the duo...

Lilly and Kara are gone...

There's Gaia in between the statues...

Will now does his attack animations and walks south...now the English staff credits appear...

Kara comes back again...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FlS0mRi.png" alt="sunset" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

They look at the sunset, wind blowing at their hair, and fish flopping...

They see the letter from the bottle again...

They're now at Freejia with Lilly, Erik, and Lance in tow.

Along with Grandpa and Grandma...

And the King and Queen, and Lance's father, and the Vampires...

There's Ishtar painting an Angel...

Luke also makes an appearance, and Neil's parents too, the old men in Euro, and the villagers too, and the merchant and his Kruk...

Along with the Jackal! \*hisses\*

They run to the Tower of Babel...

They're now in space...

Post-credits scene time! 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ycseslq.png" alt="modern will" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

There's Will in the hallway!

The bell rings...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YhRnsfI.png" alt="class over" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

The PA tells the dismissing students to be careful when crossing the street...

Here come Will's friends!

I listen to the South Cape tune for a bit before turning the game off...

<a href="http://vgmaps.com/Atlas/SuperNES/IllusionOfGaia-TowerOfBabel(Unmarked).png">Here's the map of the Tower of Babel</a>, and <a href="https://www.terraearth.com/illusion-of-gaia/">some additional information from a fansite regarding *Illusion of Gaia*</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110131193655/http://www.terraearth.com/illusion-of-gaia/translations/">the differences between the Japanese and official English translations of this game</a>. 

I admit I peeked into some spoilers in that site a bit before facing the final boss in this game, most notably, nobhg gur frperg qhatrba gung V pbhyq unir tbar vagb vs V unq pbyyrpgrq nyy svsgl Erq Wrjryf. Gur obff gurer vf onfvpnyyl gur svefg obff sebz *Fbhy Oynmre*, naq V jva abguvat vs V svavfu gung qhatrba. Nabgure fubpxvat gjvfg, V sbhaq bhg, gubhtu, jnf gung gur Wrjryre jnf gur pnhfr sbe gur fynirel va-havirefr.

I was expecting the game to be short, but maybe because I wrote a lot, put this off at some points, and took plenty of screencaps that it turned out longer than I had expected...

For anyone reading my liveblogs, thank you again, for sticking around till the end! I've said this before, but it really means a whole lot!
