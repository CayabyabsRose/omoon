Before heading to the next area, I buy a few more Fire Rings...

Now that we've talked to the Ra Tree, a vine to climb is now set up for us in Guiana.

Thank you, Ra Tree.

I have Ark speak to the flower, who gives him a message.

The flower gets down to business.

**Flower:** "When more living things are revived, they will come to your help. Ahead there is land that was a paradise [for] birds. Like us, the birds must be awaiting your help."

Up the vine we go...

Holy heck, that's a nice horizon...

A bunch of boulders, or a clump of moss, tells us to head north.

We cross Central America...

...and make it to North America, where we end up near the edge of the desert, where Colorado, in-universe, is supposed to be.

I wander around North America, accidentally ending up near a forest. We go back.

At the foot of the western mountain range, we make it to a "sanctuary." A book, two souls (shops), and a flower await.

The flower laments, mentioning a bird sanctuary that used to exist in this area. The birds' cries echo around the flower...

So that's where our next stop is going to be...

The magishop here has new wares: a Pyro Ring, and the Grass Pin that the Tree gave us.

I check our jewel box.

So that's where the Grass Pin is.

I save before speaking to the flower again, who heals Ark's wounds.

I check back to that forest in the southeast.

Ooh, treasure...

It's another healing bulb and more money.

Outside again...

This small clump of mountains in the middle is probably our next dungeon.
