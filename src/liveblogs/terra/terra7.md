The camera pans down, showing the scale and might of the first tower.

Masked faces on the walls, knights flanked to the tower with swords, and a staircase to a sealed entrance. This tower is definitely not haunted. 

But, it's probably quite ominous.

**Ark:** "So this is what [the Elder] was calling a tower. Heh, I'm getting excited here."

As he runs up the stairs to the entrance...

Holy heck! A face! Ark's reaction is the same as mine. He tells the face on the door not to scare him.

**Face on gate:** "I am the Guardian. What business have you here?"

I'm given a decision. Should I tell the guardian what we're doing, or to "step aside"? I do the first part.

Ark asks the guardian how he could save his village. The guardian tells us to go inside the tower.

**Guardian:** "Within wander countless souls of living things. Reach the uppermost floor and gain the power to control the world." Control the world? Oh dear... :frowning2:

The guardian knows Ark's name. Has this Guardian been watching him since he unsealed that box too?

**Guardian:** "**Will you test your fate?**"

The face disappears and the way is open.

I take a deep breath before entering.

The first two official monsters we face in the tower are some roly-poly-like monsters, except they have one eye!

After a third one is gone, we climb more stairs.

I check the menu, and check the map of the tower.

I wonder how I can have Ark perform the other attack moves?

The second floor's where the real challenge begins...

I meet up with one of those flame orbs again. I have to remember to be careful about them, since they can hurt Ark pretty badly.

On the other side of the perch, more monsters, and I pick up our first **Magirock** of the game!

After descending down the stairs, I check the map again. It turns out I can scroll through the map.

This tower has five floors, the question mark at the top floor probably marking the boss.

After more flame orbs are gone, I see a flashing bulb of light. Is it a fairy?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ilTd4UA.png" alt="i am wandering soul" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

**Soul:** "**Living things have been transformed into monsters.**" What?

**Soul:** "**Like you have saved me, save the others.**"

The portcullis to the next floor opens up, and the soul vanishes!

I realize our health has recovered after saving that soul, as I proceed to take care of another flame orb.

Yay, Ark!

Ark folds his arms and cheers!

I realize now that Ark's health regenerates.

Onto the third floor, where more surprises await!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4PiFDDC.png" alt="knight again" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Oh no, it's that colossus knight again!

Not just one knight, but two of them. Taking advantage of the open space I have, I use it to slowly win the battle, and avoid their mighty lances!

Going up, more enemies, and another Magirock await!

We free another soul, who gives us advice: "**Fighting alone is not strength. Observation is the solution.**"

On the left perch, we see more items to take.

Feeling a bit lost, I check the map again, where I see an exit on the southern end of the map.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/L8v8FNB.png" alt="south exit" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

Yikes!

Lucky Ark's holding on to a chain...

Up to the fourth floor we go!

The character animation of Ark is so fluid, and it shows when he's climbing on the chain rope.

Two more monsters to face...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6bnktSo.png" alt="way down" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

It seems like this is going to be a one-way trip.

Falling down, and climbing another staircase, where I see one of those giant lance knights. Without a care, I have Ark charge at them.

Now how to get that Magirock?

Meeting another knight, I pull the same strategy as last time.

Now for the third knight...
