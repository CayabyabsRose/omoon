There's the Elder on the other side of the chasm...what is he planning?

Ark's in amazement.

**Ark:** "Wow! That's some story. I'm trying to come to grips with it. You're thinking grand [...] though. I have to hand it to you."

**Elder:** "Once you venture across, **you cannot return until your duty is done.**" Oh god... :frowning2:
