I have Ark circle around the room twice, noticing the door to the console.

But as we step forward into the center of the room, the Guardian speaks.

The Guardian commends us, and chuckles their creepy chuckle...

...and gives us another "challenge."

A **High Cadet**, who splits themselves into three, appears!

I play the High Cadet's game of illusions, managing to win on my third try. It's not over yet...

After a few rounds of "spot the real High Cadet mage", we win!

The Guardian speaks to us again.

The Guardian re-opens the bridge, and we make it!

Now at the third console...

The globe descends on Ark, and the continent-creating magic happens again.

I'm guessing that we've revived Africa!

I'm right!

The family in the northwest house has returned!
