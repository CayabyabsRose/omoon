Now in a tunnel of darkness...

Talking to the man here, he's frozen...

I go back up, where one guy warns me not to go down there. I agree, but there's only one way to go forward and that's down...

Before I do, I save.

Deeper still, I see the other two guys, who are also frozen.

Down one more flight of stairs, the voice calls again.

"**...come...help...**"

What is that?

I go forward, where touching the spinning gem bounces Ark back!

"**Now! Soothe your soul. Calm down...Gently now...Touch this...box...**"

A flash of light, and a flying creature appears! Is it harmful?

**Ark:** "W-what is this!? It spoke!"<br/>
**Creature:** "You got something against me talking?"

The creature doesn't like being called an 'it.'

**Yomi:** "I have a proper name, y'know. **Yomi**."

Ark thinks the Elder kept Yomi locked in a box because of how unusual Yomi looked.

Yomi explains the situation.

A world inside the box?

Ark asks about the box that sealed Yomi. It's in Ark's hands.

**Yomi:** "Whoever breaks the seal on the box gains the right to own it. From now on, you can go to and from inside the box by pressing the **Select** key."

Yomi decides to take us inside the box.
