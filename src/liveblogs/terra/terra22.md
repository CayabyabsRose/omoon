We're now at the next chapter of this game!

Where will Ark land?

Where is Ark now? In Australia, or in Eurasia?

"**How much time has passed? Ark slowly opened his eyes to a barren wasteland devoid of life.**"

Ark wakes up and looks around.

**Ark:** "So this is [from] the hole I came through. There's no turning back now."

**Ark:** "Barren land, stale air. No life could exist here."

Yeah, where do we start, Ark?

Yomi bounces out of nowhere and giggles.

**Yomi:** "Ark. You can think but that won't change the world."<br/>
**Ark:** "Yeah, You can afford to be optimistic. We've been suddenly dropped into an empty world. It's hard not to be worried about what's up ahead."

Where to start, though?

I have Ark walk around the wasteland.

Up north, we find a save point!

Once we save this file, we cannot return to the world where we came from...

I save and proceed.

<a href="https://youtu.be/uBH0orRDkjw">The music for this map sounds different, less tragic, more orchestral</a>.

A prompt above Ark's head shows where we are: near the Amazon River. So we've been dropped into South America.

I go to the blue pool in the middle of the river: Evegreen.

Holy heck, the whole place is covered in lava!

As we move forward, a voice calls to Ark.

A few steps later, the voice calls Ark again...

Is this the Tree of Mana talking to us?

There's a lost soul west of the dead tree...

The lost soul has items that they can sell us.

I have Ark crawl into the small hole in the tree, entering a dead cavern, where a plant's shooting out deadly spores...

I leave the cavern and go back to the world map.

Other locations I visit:

The Guiana...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kVsHMLs.png" alt="desolate land" width="360" height="270" id="liveblog" />

This blowing, desolate snowfield...or is it a desert?

The soul here is a Magishop keeper, who has a Fire Ring and a Zap Ring to sell us.

I purchase two Fire Rings and two Zap Rings. Here they are:

I return to the cavern, and save before the tunnel forward.
