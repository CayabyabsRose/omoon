It's Elle!

She asks Ark if he's okay, and sees Yomi!

Yomi snarks at her presence. She's not used to seeing flying creatures.

**Elle:** "...I don't know...Ark...I'm frightened...I...I...I feel terribly scared."

Uh oh....

She tells Ark not to leave her alone.

With a flash of light, she's frozen!

Ark is not happy, and asks what Yomi did.

**Yomi:** "Oooh scary! But right about now, **everyone in the village should be like that.**" 

**What?**

I'm guessing someone was sealed along with Yomi.

Yomi tells Ark some advice in order to free her.

Yomi bounces twice and vanishes in a speck of light. Ark runs to the wall.

**Ark:** "Hey! What do you mean!?"

Ark now realizes the Elder hid and sealed that box for a reason.

Everyone's frozen.

The pot's still bubbling in front of the frozen chef...

As I press select to take the pic above, I get sent inside the Menu Box, where Yomi, who's now a cursor, is.

I look inside the Jewel Box.

Mmmm, so these are where the quest items are going to be kept...

Looking through the guidebook now, where I'm given a list of the things Ark can do, like crawling and pushing blocks. Ark can even walk on a tightrope!

I look at the attack guide: it seems that Ark has a specialized attacks for certain types of enemies.

The menu is integrated into the story of the game instead of being its own separate thing, I like it.

I stop and save here for tonight, since it's super late now.
