Nothing new from our expedition so far...

But I get into a back attack with lizard priests!

Laphicet points out Mahina turned into a daemon while trying to find Kamoana her daughter...poor her...

She's still looking for her daughter.

**Laphicet:** "Rokurou, Dyle, and Kurogane all remember what they wanted when they were human, right?"

Rokurou's considering other possibilites.

Eleanor denies that daemons "have a sense of motherhood." My lord, the prejudice against daemons is strong in Eleanor! But she says that's not Mahina now...

Rokurou and Laphicet are in shock at what she's saying here about Mahina...

**Laphicet:** "Velvet and Rokurou still have empathy."

Eleanor recalls her memories of her village getting attacked by daemons.

**Eleanor:** "Thus my path is clear."

Rokurou's considering mercy killing at this point too. Laphicet's face is too sad...

I get to another **skit** where Rokurou asks if Innominat's an Empyrean or not...

Rokurou explains the embodiment of Innominat "as an eight headed dragon" according to the song.

**Rokurou:** "The Empyreans are supposed to be these holy beings, but using therions to feed on malevolence sounds more sinister than divine..."

It does sound suspect.

Eleanor agrees Empyreans are malakhim, exceptional ones.

Laphicet wonders what happens if therions meet...

Rokurou guesses they'll fuse "into a giant horrific monster!" Rokurou, you teaser, but he has a point. Eight heads vs. six allies. Or, maybe the song was being abstract...

Magilou jests that she could cast a double!

Laphicet thinks each head might have their own free will...

And more teamwork speeches! Velvet, Eizen, and Magilou don't buy it.

We face another quartet of sword wielding **Guard**s before going to the west corridor and to the door there.

More stairs to climb, and we find another chalice!

I turn on the chalice here!

The waterfall that pours down creates a bridge!

But we can't go further...

I shut off the waterfall, the bridge is still there!

Into the next door where I see another chalice, and the way back down...

Another crack in the wall behind the chalice...

I break through, finding another monolith with a gem and a Katz Box east of it!

The Katz gives us a **Void Normin Set** costume for Eizen.

I pull the **Flower-Shaped Gemstone** out and place it on the pedestal.

Time to dry the waterfall here...

I use the lift at the edge to go back down.

We head to the center door. Velvet thinks there's a certain way to open the door...

Magilou thinks there's traps if one opens that door improperly.

She notices the gemstones embedded in the door.

She thinks it might have something to do with the chalices...

I head east and use the lift to go up. The way to the east room aheads broken...

I head back down and enter into the room nearby.

And there's more soldiers here...

Expedition's returned, and they found a set of **Glowing Gears!**

The expedition has a new island to explore: The **Krityan Archipelago!** N *Irfcrevn* ersrerapr! Lrf!

Rokurou wants to cut those gears into pieces. No go, so he decides to cut Velvet's hair instead. I also learn that Rokurou's "the barber" in his clan. Lol...Velvet says no to that. She doesn't trust men touching her hair. She's smart.

I shut off the waterfall west of here...

I pick a fight with the **Hammerer** malakhim. They can poison us too!

Next door, I shut off the waterfall here as well.

I head back. It seems the chalice shut off the waterfall blocking a chamber in the east room.

Inside the chamber there's a monolith, and behind that, a chest, with a **Gradient Doll** inside!

I read the monolith next: 

"**The lock of the sacred sealed door** [the door in the center] **is governed by the blue and white jewels of the seven chalices.**

**When the jewels of the chalices shine, the jewels of the door shall shine alike.**

**When the seven jewels shine in unison, the way to the inner sanctum shall open.**"

Hmmm, another puzzle...

Since there are seven chalices total, their pedestal gems correspond to the gems in the door....

The flower gems are white, the teardrop gems are blue...

I figure out the puzzle for a while here.

I check the center door again, and six out of the seven jewels are shining...

I turn the chalice in the east room back on, and it seems that "mana's [starting] to permeate the temple." This means we've opened the door! **Yes!!!**

I save before heading in the center door...
