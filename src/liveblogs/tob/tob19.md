Quickest way to get down would be using the icy slopes here...

More battles later, I'm getting new titles for Rokurou!

Rokurou asks Velvet another question: if "the daemons she kills turn back into humans."

That's actually some new information there...Rokurou mentions that every daemon he takes care of stays that way...

Rokurou believes it might depend on the case involved for each person. Velvet doesn't care on the outside, but she's now wondering about that question in her head...

Maybe it's because for every daemon Velvet eats, in a way, she's taking out the daemonblight from them? Like with what she did with the villagers in Aball? And if so, maybe for every daemon she eats she becomes less human?

There's some builders from the guild near the ship...

The guildmaster tells us the ship's keel's wrecked...he decides it's better that the guild build a new ship for the party.

No ship now. Velvet tells the guild to go home.

Velvet hopes that there's still time...

Now at the Hellawes Sanctuary, there's Teresa praying to the Empyrean **Innominat.**

Oscar walks in to the Sanctuary...

Teresa greets him and is in shock! Oscar's left eye is bandaged from the fireball Velvet threw at him!

So Oscar came to visit his sister...

Teresa assumes that the daemon that did this to Oscar does not fight fair. Well, Oscar's malak threw the first blow...

Oscar explains Velvet's powers to Teresa, and describes Velvet as a "girl with black hair and eyes full of fire."

Teresa's eyes widen. She knows who Oscar's talking about.

Oscar bids her goodbye. Teresa reassures him.

**Teresa:** "Worry not. A failure as minor as this is not the end of the world."

Oscar says that he came to see her just so she could lift his spirits...

Oscar points out Teresa's earrings. She considers them her treasure...I'm assuming those might've been a gift from Oscar. Oscar salutes and leaves.

As Oscar leaves, Magilou is caught!

In Magilou's perspective, she wasn't stowing away, just "boarding a ship without permission," which is basically stowing away...

Teresa now wants answers about Velvet's whereabouts. Magilou does not cave in, except she does...oh no...
