I got tempted to read the guide to check the Recipes List in this game, and there's 30 of them total...

I wonder how we could get those recipes? Maybe we could ask Benwick to scout for more treasures and hopefully he'll get us one.

Before I do that, a Katz holding small balloons catch my eye...

They have minigames called **Chamballoon** and **Slash Beat**. I listen to the rules for both games. The first minigame is similar to a shooting gallery but is considered like a regular battle. With the second minigame, I have to do as much damage as I can within a time limit.

Depending on my performance on those minigames, I get Tales coins, which I can trade for certain prizes.

I use Laphicet for Slash Beat and I win 36 Tales coins!

Now for Rokurou for Chamballoon! I win more Tales coins, and a **Void Normin Set** for Velvet for beating it!

The Void Normin mascot is cute...

More tries at those minigames again...

After getting some rewards, we move on...

If the Aifread crew knows we're in trouble, they will "sail to the rescue," even if they're on land. Hee...

The Abbey's **really** got a tight grip on when the ships set sail. They use Vortigern to enforce what goes in and out of Midgand. The sailor, as per usual, says "it's necessary" because of daemons and pirates out at sea. My god...

No ships are sailing from Hellawes...

We get our first Sugar from a sack and find another Katz box! This one needs 75 spirits to open it!

Not even gambling's allowed under the Abbey's watch...

From a merchant we find out the *Van Eltia*'s registered as the *Van Valvali*, and from rumors, he says pirates might own the ship...Aifread's crew's hiding in plain sight.

More praise for the exorcists again...

Two women talk about the *Van Eltia*'s crew. One of them's a bit creeped out by Eizen's glare...

One merchant says that another crew led by Marcus, one of the Pirate Kings, was taken out by other pirates, and only Aifread's left to stand up to the Royal Navy.

That merchant is the liaison between Aifread and the Abbey, I'm guessing.

We speak to some guards. The only way to Loegres for the ceremony is by the south road.

Merchants are talking about the awesomeness of crabs and their anatomy now. Laphicet mentions the proper term: autotomy. 

Another merchant calls another a "bro," and Rokurou's tempted to sell Dyle's tails for a good price after mentioning that lizard tails can regenerate. 

Laphicet asks if they're tasty. Velvet's disgusted by the idea of eating lizard tails...

The merchant then makes a "pinching" pun about crabs.

A woman, who's traveled far from home with her husband, is super excited to meet "the Savior of the World." She's even crying!

We get some **Legendary Doubanjiang** in a pot...it's used for Mabo Curry Buns. Hmmm...

Almost everyone's excited for the ceremony. Too bad it's going to be ruined by us...

The weapons merchant here's selling Calcite equipment. We take the lot!

More info about a temple being built north of the nearby highway, but it's only for Abbey members...the woman calls them "selfish."

After a few weapon enhancements, I read the synopsis. I chuckle a bit at Rokurou being "an amicable guy."

Rokurou even asks what "Laphicet" means in the synopsis. Velvet gives him the "it's a trade secret" line.

At the inn, there's a family from Hellawes who came all the way to Midgand to see the ceremony.

There's even people from Yseult (Izoold?) coming to see the ceremony.

The sailor in the inn's heard about Titania. Velvet and Rokurou confirm his rumors, except for "people not breaking out of there alive." Eizen "persuades" the sailor to not say a word about the crew as escaped prisoners.

After a rest-and-save, it's time to talk to Benwick about the scouting ship. He says that the crew's exploring to make a map of the entire world...Laphicet and Rokurou are super interested. Velvet and Magilou don't get why Aifread's crew is doing that.

Eizen explains how we could do that. In addition, we could get more treasures, or "food, or brand new recipes!" Yes!

I now get a new menu option: **expedition!** I go through the tutorial...and have the scout ship explore the Leymon Sea!

It's pretty quick!

And that's it for the tutorial!

Rokurou's all smiles and excitement at the idea of finding new stuff! Laphicet's excited about the places the ship finds! Eizen's open to new shortcuts...Velvet doesn't care. Magilou's excited to eat more types of fish. She even mentions yellowtail...lol...

Time to head out, but guards have sighted a powerful daemon in the highway! They label them as a "code red daemon", meaning they're on the most wanted list. We **cannot** be unprepared when we face a "code red daemon."

**Skit:** Eizen asks about what Velvet knows about Aifread on the prison island. 

Magilou gives info about that: he was taken about a year ago, and was considered to be a very important prisoner by the way the Abbey took him out of the prison. Plus, he's only a human....

My god, he must have something the Abbey wants...

We leave Port Zekson, wary of the Abbey's tight enforcement in Midgand.
