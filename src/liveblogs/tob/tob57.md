On the way back we meet up with our old friend Zaveid the Whirlwind!

Eizen charges after him, but Zaveid stops him at gunpoint! There's guns in this *Tales* game!?

He tells us "[he's] got a date lined up."

The gun's originally Aifread's. 

Eizen asks why he has it. Aifread must have dropped the gun...

They're almost about to fight again... :frowning2:

But Zaveid just wants to talk this time...

**Zaveid:** "I'the like to play with you more, but I don't want to keep ol' pointy beard waiting."

He vanishes in the wind...

Laphicet yells at Eizen, reminding him about the mission. Velvet's the cool head here, and we decide to go back to Reneed minus Eizen.

**Expedition check:** We get a **Three Meat Ragu Sauce** recipe: mole, wolf, and bat meat over pasta! Eeeee...

We get to the village. Laphicet's curious about the gun Zaveid held. None of the crew has seen a gun before...

Magilou thinks the gun came from a distant continent...

The rest of the party wonders what's Zaveid's MO. "Ol' pointy beard," or Aifread, is who Zaveid might be meeting with...

Laphicet mentions his conversation with Benwick, and Aifread's feature of having a "pointy beard."

Rokurou makes the same guess I made: Zaveid's the "wanted malak" the Abbey's after.

Eizen still went after Zaveid even though he knows it's a trap. Much like Rokurou when it comes to his brother...

The rain's finally stopped.

Some villagers are suspicious about the Abbey's secret missions...

One soldier and merchant mention how Lothringen was found, excavated by malakhim under orders by Legate Melchior. There were malakhim hibernating underground!?

The herbalist doesn't want any trouble from us. Oh well...

I do more business at the weapon shop.

I collect the reward for fighting the code red daemon in the Warg Forest.

We see a stack of frogs staring at the sea...Magilou makes up a poem from the frogs. Two haikus, to be exact...

Magilou mentions her gambling past...where she lost all her winnings.

**Eleanor:** "I think we can call that 'poetic justice.'"

At the port, an erudite merchant mentions that Westgand is slowly moving north, and Northgand and Westgand will become one continent! No Vortigern needed.
