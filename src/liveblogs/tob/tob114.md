This place looks very beautiful.

Magilou and Bienfu jump out of the portal. She points out we got eaten by an earthpulse.

**Bienfu:** (to Magilou) "This happened to you before, didn't it?" Yes.

So Innominat's using the entire landmass above as his vessel?!

**Magilou:** "In other words, this earthpulse is now part of his body."

So Magilou escaped that...

**Magilou:** "...I guess I won my bet. Took long enough." So the Revenge-a-thon's over...

**Melchior:** "Bravo. You do have a talent, if nothing else."

There's Melchior and Teresa's other malak.

She commands Bienfu to keep the rift open! She puts up a barrier!

**Magilou:** "But if you run, my curse will follow you for eternity!"

**Magilou:** "It looks like I just won my bet. If I let you seal this rift now, I'll never collect."

Melchior pulls out one of his orbs...

**Magilou:** "Illusions won't work on me. You can't break a heart that's already broken."<br/>
**Melchior:** "...That day, I interrupted my arte when your heart broke. I suppose I was taking pity on my student."

I knew it! They did have a history together!

Now he uses his gravity magic on her!

Phi wakes up...

Eleanor's there with him...

...and they're in an earthpulse yet again.

Velvet's with them too, but now her conscience is catching up to her...she says nothing but kill and destroy...

Oh god... :frowning2:

Hearing Eleanor's voice, she comes to.

Velvet still denies that Innominat is her brother, thinking he's still an illusion. It looks like there's two betrayals she has to go through.

**Velvet:** "Then that means...**he betrayed me, doesn't it?**"

She, in all her rage, lunges closer to Phi! She gets into his face! :frowning2:

Phi apologizes.

Eleanor tries to stop Velvet.

Then a flash of light...

It's a flashback...to Velvet and Laphi in the first moments of the game...

Phi and Eleanor are watching too.

Velvet slashes at the memory!

Velvet's too far gone at this point.... :frowning2:

She pushes Phi's head down and yells at him...**stop shouting at Phi!!** :frowning2:

Eleanor hits her!

Eleanor tries to calm her down...she does so. Velvet's acting different now, Mytho-like, and walks away. Phi picks up the comb she dropped.

We're at the **Earthpulse, River of Nature's Power**.

Poor Phi...

Phi decides to stay with Velvet. He doesn't have to owe Velvet anything after what she did earlier, but here he is. All he can do is just stay with her.

**Eleanor:** "Having someone nearby can be all the help you need sometimes." That's true.

**Eleanor:** "Just remember that I am always with you, Laphicet."

**Eleanor:** "Whatever the case we have to get out of here. Let's keep moving for now."<br/>
**Phi:** "Yeah. I guess so."

And that's it for tonight!

Damn, that was long, and there's a lot to take in at this point...
