Ahead, the cage keeping Medissa is also sealed.

To the east is a passage leading to our way out...

Beyond the bars we see Medissa slumped on the floor.

I head up and unlock our getaway first!

Now to light the four candles...

...and the doors open!

Without opening her bandages, Velvet touches a seal! Medissa is the therion.

**Rokurou:** (to Phi) "Third time's the charm, eh, kid?"

Velvet breaks the seal!

Medissa looks like a nun...

**Velvet:** "You're Medissa, right?"

She is. She asks who we are.

**Velvet:** "We're like you. We carry grudges against the Abbey...and the Shepherd Artorius."

Eleanor assures her they're here to free her.

Medissa, though, feels hopeless.

**Medissa:** "There's no escape [...] No, you don't understand. There's no escape...**for you.**" Wait, what?!

Medissa gets up. So she's still a believer...

**Medissa:** "If you dare sully the Shepherd's ideals and the light the Abbey shines upon the world..."

She sets her stone-turning gaze on us, and unleashes her snakes!

**Medissa:** "**I will kill you all!**"

**Eleanor:** "Why are you doing this?!"<br/>
**Velvet:** "Rrrgh, she's the Abbey's lackey now!"<br/>
**Magilou:** "Way to jinx it, Rokurou!" We owe him **two** sodas for that.

Now Sea Serpents come forth! But we take care of them easy!

Oh boy...

Eizen suggests going after Medissa.

**Medissa:** "Your left hand...**don't tell me you're the Calamity.**"<br/>
**Eleanor:** "Why are you doing this...!? Why fight for the Abbey when they forced you to become a therion?!"<br/>
**Medissa:** "They didn't. **I became one of my own free will.**" **What!?**

Eleanor brings up her daughter Diana.

**Medissa:** "Oh, I feel hate. **To a world where daemons spawn from people's malevolence!**"

So that implies the exorcists know about the malak taboo as well.

Eleanor asks about Medissa's knowledge of malevolence.

**Medissa:** "I knew what I had to do. Become a therion and devour malevolence so that such a tragedy would never repeat itself."

Medissa now begins to transform...

**Medissa:** "It matters not what dreadful form my body will take. **I will revive Innominat and change this wretched world!**"

Three golems rain down!

And the transformation is complete!

**Velvet:** "Fine, we'll take you by force."

Here we go, the real battle begins!

I make adjustments to the party's equipment before starting...

**Medissa:** "I'm going to end this! **Her death will not be in vain!**"<br/>
**Eleanor:** "**She's just a grieving mother!**"

Exorcists, you manipulative monsters...

The golems are the first to be taken care of!

Rokurou's the first victim of Medissa's stone-turning gaze! Lucky in this game, that doesn't mean they're finished!

Medissa's calling for reinforcements!

And now I'm, or Rokurou's, turned to stone!

Oh my god, we're getting finished here!

I resort to using Velvet this time!

Medissa's also a powerful spellcaster!

We manage to beat her with only Rokurou and Velvet alive!

**Velvet:** "It's over."<br/>
**Medissa:** "**Curse you, Lord of Calamity!**"

**Medissa:** "**That's the name of the daemon lord who will bring about the Age of Chaos. The unrepentant embodiment of malevolence whose** [...] **pursuit of self-gratification will rain destruction upon the world. The irredeemable uncontrollable personification of human sins...** ***an evil like you!***"

Looks like Velvet got a promotion. (naq guhf, n yrtraq vf obea!)

**Velvet:** "Daemon, therion, **Lord of Calamity**...call me whatever you like. But if I'm this supposed Lord of Daemons, then you're just a minion. Nothing more."
