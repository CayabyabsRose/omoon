Let's see what's here...

The same enemies from Lake Perniya are also here.

The northmost part of the first area's got a chest containing a pair of boots!

I proceed eastward, but I notice a shortcut I can take with the geoboard, but we haven't activated the geotree for this forest yet.

There's also a new enemy here, a one-eyed troll, or a **Cyclopz**! They're easy to take care of while battling as Velvet because of their weakness to fire!

In the next vast area of the wood now...

There's plenty of enemies wandering around.

I spot Katz spirits and a chest containing a **Quartz Doll** for Magilou!

The third area of the woods has more enemies north, and a save point before the east path.

As we make our way through the east road, we hear someone screaming!

Velvet recognizes the voice! Could it be Niko?

Oh my god, it's her! What's happened?! What's going on here?

There's a huge flying mantis, and it drops down!

It's a **Xeno Mantis!**

**Velvet:** "What's going on? How can Niko be here?"

The Xeno Mantis charges at Velvet, but we dodge the move!

The Xeno Mantis also has sweeping claw attacks and other moves at its disposal, including artes like Air Thrust and Grave!

After a long battle, we finally finish off the Xeno Mantis!

**Velvet:** "I can't believe it! Is it really you?"

Niko wakes, she sees Velvet too!

Velvet pulls her blade on her!

Velvet asks why she's alive! Niko same.

So the whole village thought she was "eaten by a daemon." But Niko knows Velvet's stronger than that. She cries.

Velvet's also in shock! She hugs her, crying!

**What is going on here?**

**Niko:** "I have to let everyone know the good news! You've finally come back to us!"<br/>
**Velvet:** "**Niko's alive. She's alive.**"

Eizen gets cautious, reciting the oft-used George Lucas line, knowing this might be a trap.

**Magilou:** "Well, naturally, we've got a reaper with us!"

Phi suggests asking around in Aball.

Eizen asks Velvet if the villagers did perish by her hand under the Scarlet Night.

**Velvet:** "Well, it's...it's not like I had time to check..."

Everyone in the party's at level 40 now...

Great, there's more land to cover in the eastern part of the woods!

There's more diverging paths as well here.

In the north, we find more Katz spirits and a bronze chest. We turn back...

Another Katz box is located in the midpoint of this area.

I check the south road.

There's a fleet of enemies in this part!

We find another gap that we can cross via geoboard!

I double back to get to that side, where I find more Katz spirits and another chest.

It seems I have enough spirits to open the Katz box here!

Now heading in the central path...

Velvet still can't believe what's going on...even I can't believe what's going on!

Phi's worried about Velvet.

**Velvet:** "I know I'm right. I'm sure of it. This isn't how the village should be."

Eleanor tells Velvet to keep calm and suggests investigating around once we get there.

This does feel a lot like Nibelheim all over again...

Velvet's reassuring Eleanor, or more likely, herself, that she's fine.

Rokurou sees nothing to the contrary that that's a fake Niko.

Eizen senses something different, "unnatural" as well.

In the next area, turning a corner east to a dead end, we activate a geotree!

This is the last area of the forest before the entrance gates to Aball...

I use the geoboard to jump the gap opposite where the geotree is...

...leading into the code red daemon's den!

My lord, look at the size of the code red daemon! It's a huge boar, no, the daemon's a **Behemoth!**

The Behemoth has such a high defense that it takes a long time to beat him!

I geoboard through the rest of the area...

Here we are back in a familiar entrance...

...except there's enemies roaming about the woods now.

The gate to Aball looks a bit different, or is it just me?

I stop here for tonight.
