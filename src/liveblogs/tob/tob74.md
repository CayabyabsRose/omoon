Now there's one question on my mind: **Will Eleanor carry out her mission to bring Laphicet back to the Shepherd, or will she continue with the crew?**

Laphicet's interested in the sights now! Eleanor goes with him...oh, dear...Velvet tells them not to get lost...

One Bloodwing disguised as a soldier shows the flaws of not enhancing weapons.

Some more news from a local: the **Aldina Plains** road is about to be opened!

From one local, the Shepherd's rise has dropped daemon attacks drastically...

Magilou reminds the local that the daemons who were responsible for what happened at Hellawes are still wanted! Plus, the incident at Southgand...what a bubble burster Magilou is! She was also about to tell more stories about a "daemon doll."

Rumors are also spreading about Eleanor turning from the Abbey.

We also find Nobumichi, the second son, another Character Cards player! I have six rounds with him!

In the west of the city, there's a show going on! Majelu's Troupe is performing!

Eleanor's in awe. She seems to know Majelu, but Magilou steps in and thinks they're talking about her!

So Majelu is short for "The Majestic Lulu," a dancer.

Everyone's impressed by Majelu. Magilou's getting jealous by the second...

Magilou calls Majelu a "con artist."

**Majelu:** "I can't just ignore that, you know." Oh dear...

No, she's hearing the crowd praise and cheer for her.

Eleanor explains about her world famous instructor Valta, who had to pass on his skills to Majelu.

Now Majelu faces off against Magilou. Dance battle!

The bald Valta comes to her and reprimands her for picking a "petty fight." His pain resurges. 

He's smart, only a dance battle can solve that dispute. He's hard on Majelu because he has high expectations for her...

Eleanor knows trivia about them because she's a fan. She blushes when she says this.

Magilou calls Majelu and Valta's tale "a sweet little story" and decides to start a show: a comedy act! Since the crew doesn't know how to dance, they start making the audience laugh instead.

Velvet considers this whole scene a waste of time.

But, if they capture the audience's laughter, they'll get more money!

Rokurou plays along. He doesn't know what's happening, but at least he's a good sport about it. That's one of the reasons why I like him.

Magilou assigns Velvet "the straight man" act. Eizen agrees, since they might need the money.

Magilou figures out what role to assign to everyone next. Even Eizen...

Laphicet's "not so sure about" the whole idea...

**Expedition check:** We get a new treasure: the **Replica Key of Lorelei**, a sword!

Rokurou questions if that sword's even a key, he thinks the person who owned this "must have been a giant...three stories tall." Eleanor's curious on what the key unlocks, a "lost sound..."

Even Rokurou and Eleanor are a bit puzzled by the Key of Lorelei...

Rokurou concludes the Key might be a "key to a pair of...doors the size of sea gates, behind which a giant has locked away an extraordinary and mysterious musical instrument." Nuns.

Magilou reminds a woman of someone named **Magillanica.**

The woman mentioned that **Magillanica** had "mysterious powers."

She was labeled "the Little Witch" to her audience, and profitted. But, she got imprisoned for heresy... :frowning2:

Velvet asks for Magilou's age...Magilou reacts in a way where Velvet rules out that she might be younger or around her age...

A peddler mentions Eastgand and northeast Midgand shifting...and I learn the Isles of Lakehaven used to be a mountain range. Hmmm...but they're surrounded in an area called the Thunder Isles.

In the inn, a patron's complaining that he left his key in his room. This inn has automatic locks...

An elderly man and a woman complain about the cold and lack of flamestone...but they have to "endure." They now quote ~~Spock's~~ the Shepherd's teachings. The woman thinks he doesn't care about the people...she's getting somewhere...

Velvet rubs it in their faces that he only wants to "save humanity as a whole," not a few individuals. Eleanor apologizes for her.

The girl in the fountain's decided to endure the hardships of food rationing...

My god, everyone's so devoted to the Shepherd!

A maid's thinking of starting up a band...

A housewife's hearing true stories about the High Priest. Magilou tries to confirm, but gets shushed by Eleanor. But the description of the daemon who did the break-in is very inaccurate...

And the rumors get more exaggerated. And Magilou tries to point out the daemons in front of them! Oh my god, Magilou...

There's a lot of people in line for prayers at the Sanctuary.

One young man near the castle sees the plight of malakhim. He's so close to the truth...

One soldier says "everything is fine." Which isn't true.

A noble knows he heard "a terrible cry from the villa."

I get my reward from the Bloodwing Agent for destroying the Beast of Blades!

Velvet asks Eleanor to wait at the door, along with Laphicet. Bad idea.

Tabatha offers peach pie again. Velvet asks for info now. Tabatha tells her to take a break.

Velvet insists.

Tabatha points to a hooded person at the bar. She wants her to have him taken out of the capital...

Wait, that eagle next to him looks very familiar...

Velvet smells a trap. She asks where she should take the figure.

**Tabatha:** "Somewhere the authorities can't reach them." That could be anywhere...

Rokurou adds they haven't a hideout to go to...

Tabatha points out the Abbey hasn't heard anything from Titania.

Eizen's surprised by the news.

Velvet's open to using Titania as a hideout. It's under the Abbey's nose, in a way. Rokurou and Magilou agree.

Velvet asks Tabatha if the Abbey's been "harboring daemons." Tabatha mentions the griffin daemon was moved somewhere else...

Velvet wants more info on the daemon as a price for escorting the hooded figure out.

Tabatha apologizes to Eizen concerning Melchior and Aifread.

Eizen's not giving up on finding him, though...he plans on pressuring attacks on the Abbey until they can get Aifread back.

The Abbey will use Aifread as bait, and Eizen will spring the trap to return him to his ship.

Eleanor and Laphicet are still outside. It's night now.

Eleanor's reminded of the mission she's supposed to carry out...

She asks Laphicet if she wants to take a tour with her. Oh dear god, no...

Laphicet hesitates...but he comes along. Eleanor holds back though, thinking (rightfully so) that Velvet would get angry if they left alone...

That was close!

They're escorting the hooded figure out now.

Eleanor asks who it is. Laphicet smells a "nice" scent. If it's coming from the hooded figure, I'm guessing this must be a rich person...

Laphicet and Eleanor notice the figure's hawk beside him. The hawk is "well trained."

Laphicet and Eleanor smell the "nice" scent again. Eleanor doesn't believe who that person is! Who is that, though?

My favorite Velvet face comes up again! She asks what they're sniffing...Magilou calls them "bloodhounds on the hunt." Laphicet thinks they're "talking about hawks." Velvet's confused.

Eleanor doesn't like the "no questions asked" idea.

**Velvet:** "The less you know, the less trouble you invite."

A few people mention the King's condition, while the Bloodwing soldier at the gates wishes us good luck.

I save outside the port's gate.
