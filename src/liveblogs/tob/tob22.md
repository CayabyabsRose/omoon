Now that the malak's with us, he gains two new titles...

The malak's looking at the sea...

There's Magilou at the head, complimenting Velvet on the awesomeness of the plan and leaving Hellawes portless for now. She's still wondering if Hellawes will recover from that...

Velvet asks Magilou how much info she spilled to the exorcists.

**Magilou's response:** "I just started Episode 2: **'Magilouâ€™s Fury!' Wherein the Beautiful Witch is Captured and Tortured by a Daemon Most Cruel!**" My god, that exaggerated episode title is too funny, and the delivery of her lines too...

Even Magilou mentions her next episode in the works: "Magilou and the Tears of the Demon Lord!" It's like she's living in her own anime...

Velvet wants to set course for the capital Loegres. Dyle suggests they need more crewmembers if they're going to get there safely...

Rokurou's pondering something looking at the sky or the sails...

He says the same thing that Dyle suggests: more crewmembers and "to tie down the cargo."

He's also unfurled the sails as well. He's unsure if the knot he tied is tight at this point...

Rokurou says he's good at cutting things, but tying isn't his forte. If Rokurou were to be given a Gordian Knot, he'd cut it immediately.

***Aside:*** I can relate to Rokurou a bit when it comes to tying things too...I worry whether my laces would come loose at any moment and they sometimes do.

I have Velvet talk to the malak last. I breathe in and out before going to him, knowing Velvet's reaction...

She looks at him with a terrible face.

Dyle (or Rokurou?) ask Velvet about the heading. She can't read the compass...I can't read compasses either, or at least I try to...

The child malak tells Velvet she's holding the compass wrong. He adds that it's meant to move alongside the ship's movement.

Velvet holds the compass steady at the base.

She asks the malak about his real name. He has no real name, he says.

Velvet asks him to hold the compass. His answer and the exchange below is a bit heartbreaking...

**Malak:** "If that's an order."
**Velvet:** "I'm asking you what you want."
**Malak:** "So you're ordering me to answer?"

Now Velvet gets to the heart of the matter of the malak's purpose: as tools. Velvet "orders [him] to shut his mouth."

The ship hits something!

The compass drops into the ocean!

Pirates! What is this, **Assassin's Creed, IV**!?

So Aifread's crew attacking, huh?

Magilou states the obvious. Their ship's not armed!

Velvet orders a debark at the nearest shore to fight the pirates!

A blond pretty pirate, their captain (?) comes forth, and points out that most of Velvet's crew are daemons...

Velvet orders the malak to "wipe them out."

The captain (?) backs away and says that he's not going to fight them.

Then, a man in a dark coat with what sort of looks like the Batman logo on his back steps forward.
