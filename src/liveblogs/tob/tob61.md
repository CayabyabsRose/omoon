Our expedition came back, and they brought **Oresoren Dolls** from the Crystaliron Sea!

Eleanor calls the dolls "adorable." Velvet doesn't know who they are. She thinks they're otters. Eleanor tells her they're Oresoren.

Velvet compliments the attention to very minute detail and wonders if they're made from real Oresoren fur...

Eleanor tells her not to say things like that!

Back to Reneed we go!

At the bridge, Laphicet has a lot on his mind...

**Rokurou:** "I thought I smelled someone pondering."

Laphicet's still wondering about Siegfried. Rokurou doesn't know anything about it since he's interested in swords, not guns.

Magilou assumes Siegfried amplified Zaveid's power...

So the gun's more or less a booster, but in the case of illusions, the weapon "pushed the artes past their limits..."

Velvet thinks Siegfried's hard to master.

**Skit:** Eleanor's wondering about the girl with the umbrella and her relation to Eizen...Laphicet doesn't know but he calls the girl pretty...

Magilou has stars in her eyes...

Rokurou teases Laphicet about his compliment about the girl with the umbrella. Velvet comes by and Magilou mentions "Laphicet's first crush," which is far from true. Magilou, you troll...

Velvet knows from seeing Eizen's reaction that the girl with the umbrella is important to him...

Eleanor speculates it might be Eizen's wife or girlfriend in the past...Rokurou doesn't think so, she's too young...

Magilou speculates in her tall tale that she might be his daughter from an estranged marriage...

More speculation about the girl with the umbrella and Eizen...

Rokurou's annoyed at the speculations Velvet, Magilou, and Eleanor are jumping to. He gives Laphicet some warnings before the skit ends.

In the menu, I have Velvet try on the Aviator Glasses...hee...

Back at the Fens of Nog, I battle until the entire party's on the same level. Right now they're at Lv. 28...

In the village, an elderly man tells us about Lothringen's condition: daemons attacked the place! The narrative being told is that Melchior arrived too late. The woman's worried even a legate's not strong enough to beat the daemons...

The exorcists are now onto Velvet's crew, mentioning the broken cage and Zaveid.

A boy and a girl with a dog have a book.

Laphicet and Velvet look at it: it's another ancient book. But Laphicet guesses it's a history book of sorts.

Magilou sees the book has "Meliodasian characters," meaning this is an old book.

Laphicet sees it's been annotated by someone else.

The girl says the book probably belongs to Videl. Videl's the innkeeper's son, who's a history enthusiast.

The herbalist is worried about the Abbey on his tail and tells us to go before they see us.

After doing some business with the weapon shop, we return Videl's book.

Laphicet hands the book over to Videl. He asks Videl if he could read Meliodasian. Videl acts skeptical. Magilou giggles behind Laphicet, as he blushes.

Videl wants to be an explorer when he gets older...just like Velvet's brother. So he started reading history with the Dark Ages as his starting point.

But the eras before and after the Dark Ages are stark in their major cultural shift.

Laphicet and Videl are super excited over history books!

Velvet smiles at the nostalgia between her brother Laphicet and her other brother but then realizes "her brother" was **that man**.

Exorcists are coming! Videl hides them in the inn!

A soldier asks Videl if anyone suspicious came around. So Videl was raised by a single mother, or rather, his father's a praetor. I wonder if that praetor is going to be important.

The crew leave the inn, and Laphicet thanks Videl for hiding them. Velvet asks about his father being an exorcist. He confirms it, and wont tell anyone about them in the inn.

Awww, Laphicet's found his first friend outside the crew!

Videl tells us more about the book he's holding is the recipe for an **Omega Elixir!** Hmmmm...

So we need five ingredients to make it, with only one of them translated. He gives us the ingredient.

**Eleanor:** "The **Omega Elixir**...That's an ancient medicine able to cure any disease."

But no recipe for the medicine's survived the Dark Ages. So that book was written before the Dark Ages.

Velvet doubts Videl's ability to translate Meliodasian because he's a kid. Boo, Velvet! Boooo!

And Rokurou balances Velvet's adultism out with a good message. Two for you, Rokurou! :slight_smile:

Velvet's now recalling memories of her brother again...

Eleanor's thinking that an **Omega Elixir** might cure Velvet...

Velvet don't care as usual. But she lets Laphicet find the Elixir if he wants to.

I read the synopsis so far, where Rokurou asks Magilou to try on Kurogane...

So the first ingredient we need for the Elixir is **Long Dau Dust** (n *Kvyyvn* ersrerapr!), and we can find it in the Vester Tunnels, or more precisely, in Kurogane's Workshop!

Holy heck, there's tons of exorcists around the port! They're really that desperate!

We overhear a pirate talking about a Class 4 island. He tells us to watch out for "gooey stuff" on the Class 4 island.

Laphicet has the same question I have: What is Class 4? Eleanor explains it's a system used by the Abbey to detect how dangerous a place is. Classes 1-3 zones are relatively safe.

Basically, Class 4 Zones have monsters tougher than code red daemons, I think?

So the Abbey puts warnings but don't enforce people to stay away from Class 4 Zones...

Eizen frankly says the Abbey doesn't want to go near Class 4 Zones. Now at least we have a loose yardstick of how far-reaching the Abbey's influence is.

There's ten of these Zones total...

I spot a Class 4 Zone at Northgand's southwestern gulf on our map.

Fishermen are scared of the daemons being set loose in the Warg Forest. They're left out of the loop. They're even told not to fish at all!

It's the people that end up paying the price for these regulations...

Even villagers in the storehouse are suspicious of the Abbey's motives. But they have no other alternatives... :frowning2:

Benwick runs to us!

Eizen briefs him on the situation with their captain...

Laphicet tells Eizen to calm down.

Everyone in the crew's better and they're all ready to go!

We see Dyle fishing in the sea while Kurogane sits on the head of the ship...

We head to Cadnix Isle first to get the Long Dau Dust.

Some rumormonger mentions Shigure and the Shepherd had a duel. He's curious as to who won that duel, though.

We notice someone namedrop **Endgand.** Where is Endgand?

There's some kids playing Exorcist Cards, even Velvet notices. They're trading card games based off of the exorcists...Shigure should have been a Rank 7 instead of a Rank 5 though.

It takes a long while to get back to Kurogane's forge...

There's some semi-new treasures here to get!

We find **Long Dau Dust** on the large crystal near the forge! Velvet's surprised that we found some!

Now off to Yseult!
