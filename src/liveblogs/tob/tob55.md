We're now at more wetlands...

So the Burnack Plateau is up north, while our sale'tomah flowers are in the east...

I save at the nearby save point here.

There's a lot of giant **Trolls** and **Witches** around here.

I also encounter **Mud Slimes** here too...

Crossing another bridge, Eleanor asks Laphicet about Eizen's curse. She's guessing it's a side effect of having the coin as Eizen's vessel.

Magilou then tells another scary tale about Vortigern. Eleanor's skeptical about the Reaper's Curse.

Bienfu misses Eleanor a lot!

Magilou, you troll...

Then Bienfu digs his hole deeper.

Eleanor considers Bienfu a "stranger."

Velvet's "not amused" look is comedy legend...she pulls Laphicet away from Eleanor...

Eizen shrugs, not knowing what's going on...

This place has got plenty of tall rocky spires, even though it's a marsh...

I pick a fight with Trolls now...

And while getting some Rosemary, **Skunk**s!

Eleanor's fine for now. Laphicet warns her that the Reaper's Curse is a thing. Eleanor's still skeptical...

Magilou scares them again...

Bienfu delivers more info about what happened to Eizen's crew and other tall tales.

Eizen says Bienfu's lying. Everyone of their opponents caught daemonblight, and seven warships, not four, came near the *Van Eltia*. Yikes...

Rokurou says not to worry, as long as sale'tomah flowers are blooming, everything's fine.

Eleanor throws in the <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/I_have_a_bad_feeling_about_this">George Lucas trademark line</a> here.

Our expedition crew's getting stronger, and we're getting more recipes! 11 recipes out of 30 so far!

I collect most of the treasures, and do more level grinding around the marsh. So far, Velvet's entire crew is now at level 25!

Soldiers are blocking the way to the Burnack Plateau, mentioning that exorcists are training around Lothringen.

Onto more exploring!

Skipping past big stones, it seems that we found one of our code red daemons here!

But I ignore her and open the gold chest on the island here: a **War Pike!**

And my PS4 controller runs out of power!

Back to business now, as I do more exploring and level grinding here before saving before the Warg Forest entrance...

<p><h2 class="entry-title">Tales of Berseria - Part 55a: A Literal Trickstar</h2></p>

I face off against the code red daemon with luminous wings: the **Trickstar!**

She also has help again: three spellcasting Witches!

After changing Rokurou's artes to earth-based ones, I take care of them in no time!

Now for the Trickstar, who's weak against fire!

I change Rokurou's artes to fire-based martial artes, since she's very weak to those...

She's a bit of a tough one to go down...

Currently, Rokurou's already Fatigued! I wonder what caused that?

She guards herself a lot!

But eventually, like all enemies, she goes down! In this case, the final blow's from Rokurou's Fire arte!

We get an **Oppressor's Ventite** as a reward! It increases damage to an enemy in the middle of a "weak point combo."

We collect our reward from the Bloodwing agent, and customize our weapons a bit further.

After some exploring and collecting out in the wetlands, I save and stop my session here again.
