What a blizzard the place is!

Phi and Rokurou point out they're almost closer to Meirchio and Mt. Killaraus.

Eleanor's shivering...it's **supercold** here. Let's hope we can get to Meirchio fast.

**Velvet:** "Keep moving. The cold and the climb don't matter."

She's not affected by it...or is she?

The new monsters here are **Winter Wolves**, **Wild Boars**, **Freezillos** (freezing Armadillos), and **Executioners**, who are slugs with guillotines on their backs!

In one battle, Laphicet unleashes his second Mystic Arte: **Chaos Bloom!**

This lake is so vast and so frigid...

The next area is also as vast and as snow white.

There's perfect icicles around the area too...

But the east way, where a code red's supposed to be, is blocked by a huge permafrost wall, or I'm in a lower area.

Down the slope, and behind the icicle wall, I grab a **Mythril Waistcoat!**

There's also a fishing spot in the western part of this area!

Now to find a way to get to the code red daemon!

The guard at the gate to Meirchio's shivering, and he's tasked to guard the city for three sleepless days...

He lets Velvet and crew enter Meirchio.

**And I save at the point before the gate, ending this week!**
