Back inside the Yvolg Ruins...

From watching a playthrough, I have Velvet kick open a brick wall in this room...

...and take the treasures within, which include another Thorny Waistcoat!

Rokurou's a bit intimidated by the Shepherd and Innominat's powers...

He keeps smiling cause "he's still alive," and can still fight. That's why I sort of like him, he keeps his spirits up even in the face of danger.

Velvet's not going to stop her quest for vengeance. A part of her wishes it, I think?

Rokurou is still joining her, as he owes both her and Laphicet for saving his life.

**Rokurou:** "I might not look it, but duty and honor flow thru my veins!" Yep. Laid-back, yet traditionalist is Rokurou's personality.

He tells us to ignore Magilou though, and thank Laphicet.

Eizen next. He points out the rogues gallery that we've become now that an exorcist is in the ranks. Velvet says that "[she] had no other choice."

Laphicet is important more than ever now...

Velvet asks Eizen if Innominat is actually an Empyrean. Eizen don't know.

So the crew's next mission now is to expose the Abbey's plans, and find out what they will use Innominat for. They're also going get info out of Eleanor as well, but lucky Velvet rules out torture from the list. It **never** works. 

Eizen also adds that without a vessel, a malak becomes a daemon!

Magilou and Laphicet are outside the ruins...

Bienfu's looking over the unconscious exorcist.

I get new info from Bienfu: whenever a person makes a pact with a malak, they have side effects. In Magilou's case, it's excessive sneezing, and it happened during spring...

Outside, we're at the **Brigid Ravine, Valley of Howling Winds.**

There's Laphicet looking across the ravine...

Where's Magilou?

From a nearby chest, I get **Flouric Boots**!

One of Velvet's idle animations has her look at her brother's comb...

We go to Laphicet.

Velvet tells him not to overdo it. Well, that's a fine greeting, Velvet! /sarcasm

He apologizes for disobeying her...

She thanks him for keeping her alive.

He looks down.

He didn't want to see her die... :frowning2:

She apologizes for treating him very badly, but he chose to come with her...

He asks if she's continuing her quest. He knows she is. No turning back.

And Laphicet's seeing this through to the end as well.

Laphicet makes a good point: Where exactly in the map are we? Where exactly is the **Brigid Ravine** located?

**Magilou:** "An object misused is one thing, a person misused is quite another!"

She asks Velvet what her next move is, now that the plan to take down the Shepherds failed...

Velvet's going to continue her quest, her "Revenge-a-thon."

**Velvet:** "**No matter how many times I have to try, Iâ€™ll devour them all.**"

Magilou makes a bet again, 100 gald this time.

Velvet says "whatever." Magilou's coming along too...

Deep down, Magilou does care how this whole story plays out.

Laphicet has more info about Innominat, from the book in the villa. The crest on the book's cover says it all!

It does say something about Innominat but it's ancient. Magilou knows someone named **Grimoirh** who could translate it.

Last time, she checked Grimoirh was last seen in Yseult...hmm...

Velvet's not giving up, though...

**Magilou:** "That's the spirit. Don't give up just yet." It's more fun for her when the bad stuff happens to the characters, yet they still carry on.

Tired, we head back to the ruin...

Eleanor wakes up!

She's not happy that she's in the company of daemons...

She calls herself a disgrace and is about to cry again...but keeps it together.

She's about to come closer to Velvet with her spear...eeee...

Then she turns the spear on herself, no!

But a ball of light interrupts her and flies away from the ruin...

Eleanor follows the ball of light, it's the energy ball that Melchior threw in the portal!

Oh no, it's the Shepherd!

She kneels...

But the Shepherd assigns her another "special mission": as a spy! She is to "protect" Laphicet and send him to the Abbey HQ in the villa. He tells her not to share any info about this.

Oh dear, it looks like the Shepherd's capitalizing on Eleanor as Laphicet's vessel...

The Shepherd is so scummy...he plans to have her manipulate Laphicet. He orders her to side with Velvet's crew as long as she takes him back to the capital...

She cites one of his maxims: "**Shame is only a fleeting emotion. It is will and reason that ultimately prevail in the face of calamity.**"

He tells her to "use her own discretion to continue the mission."

She salutes him... 

...with Velvet and Eizen looking on...
