***Aside:*** I realized last night after my session that the Bloodwings in this game are another name for the "Dark Wings" in other *Tales* games...

I check the surrounding area maps for our next mission. Turns out the ambushers are in the same area the code red daemon is at on the highway...

The holy bottle's still in effect...

Making it to the area, it seems that we were too late to stop the ambush...

There's three people about to clean up the caravan...Velvet and the crew approach them...

...And the three ambushers are actually Gibbon daemons disguised as humans! The red crates are food to them!

We finish them off!

Rokurou smiles one of his pretty smiles after realizing that the ambushers were daemons...

The doctors ran away.

Eizen opens the crates, seeing that the daemons wanted Cathedral-approved medicine.

Laphicet finds something: it's a red scarf! The daemons disguised as humans wore that scarf...

Velvet thinks they're just daemons attacking more innocents...

Back in town, I play **another skit:** It looks like most of the citizens are onto Velvet's crew, with Rokurou hearing them mention their exploits in Hellawes and the Gate.

Eizen points out everyone's still calm for now.

Velvet sulkily notes they'll be even more famous once **that man** is finished.

Rokurou's lighting up at the idea, calling it "fun." Laphicet doesn't get his reasoning.

Rokurou mentions wanted posters and bounties on the crew's heads. He wants to see himself in a wanted poster.

I wonder how they're going to draw the crew. Badly drawn wanted posters are another *Tales* series staple. Rokurou, for some reason, is aware of this.

Eizen's seen wanted posters that "make [him] a monster," or "a handsome youth." He finds it "fascinating."

Laphicet hopes he gets to see himself in a wanted poster.

Rokurou devilishly smiles, telling Laphicet to "really stir things up." Laphicet promises "to stir [them] up good." Lol...

What a badass smile!

Now that was a short job!
