We're now out of that cell, and we head into the next hallway. All we have to do is grab equipment in a room somewhere.

I read the synopsis. So that night was called the **Advent**...the synopsis calls Velvet a "beast", and an "it." :worried:

So we started in the deepest depths of the prison.

More stairs to climb...

In the next room, the guards are KO'd. Seres tells Velvet to take what she needs in the room.

There's a rope, and a blade: **Stormhowl!** But it's too big for Velvet to wield! Seres is quite shocked that a "legendary blade" is in a simple bronze chest...

But to Velvet, she sees no use for it.

Now she's suited up to the nines, like a punk rocker out of hell...

But a guard interrupts the scene, an **exorcist orderly**...

Seres and Velvet take care of him effortlessly.

Velvet knows that they're in Titania, a prison for violent criminals, and daemons.

**Velvet:** "Daemons say a lot of things when they don't want you to eat them." \**shudders internally*\*

Their escape ship is in the back entrance of the prison...

Now where's a save point?

I realize I can quick save in this game, but I wonder how it works? Does it delete automatically after it loads?

Now that was a twist...everything happened so fast...
