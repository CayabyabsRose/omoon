We wander around the cave some more to scavenge for some more materials...

I'm dodging and weaving past monsters...

One villager in Beardsley doesn't want anything to do with what happened in the Hollow.

The Apple Girl's looking for a Fortune Apple...

I sell more raw materials, buy more stuff, and rest up before doing more level grinding outside...

After switching formation, I immediately get pointers on Rokurou's Break Soul arte: **Vengeful Stance**...

More battles to go through...

There's still merchants outside the gates of the city...

I head back one area to the cold shores of the icecaps to add more battles in the bag...

I save back at the ladder to the storehouse.

In the storehouse, we pick up some olive oil...

I wonder where we can get more cooking recipes?

Back in the city proper, we speak to a young woman who's "lucky the snow's been white." Velvet thinks she's stating the obvious. But in Hellawes, snow isn't always white...the woman says that ash from a nearby volcano turns that snow gray...uh oh...

The volcano, **Mt. Killaraus**, causes that gray snow, and according to the woman, it's the biggest volcano in Midgand. It's north of Hellawes, and is the only source of flamestone...

Rokurou asks curiously to Velvet if she's ever seen a volcano.

Velvet hasn't seen one, and as usual, doesn't care.

The young woman mentions cleaning the snow off of the roof is a pain...

It seems that I missed a chest in the city. It has an Amber Fragment.

We show Dyle's tail to the guildmaster.

Velvet says that Dyle's body was found in a tar lake, and says that the tail was the only piece of proof.

But the guild can't continue unless Lady Teresa's given her consent to open business again. Ay, the red tape!

Velvet then blackmails them by threatening to tell them who the actual smugglers are: them.

The guildmaster agrees to have the guild rebuild their ship.

Rokurou suggests to Velvet in upgrading their equipment. She's not used to that idea. Rokurou then gets going to the weapon shop.

**Velvet:** "H-Hey, you don't need to be so pushy!"<br/>
**Rokurou:** "That's just how I am. Get used to it. Come on." He smiles warmly.

We can now customize our equipment at shops, yes!

I'm now given a tutorial on how to upgrade weapons, in this case, it's Velvet's Blood Blade.

All I just need are the required materials and the money to upgrade...for this first time, it's free...

...and I'm set!

This weapons system reminds me a bit like **Dark Cloud**'s system. But unlike that game, weapons don't break here.

The amount of upgrades I can make on a weapon depends on the type of "Acerite" I have.

I can also dismantle weapons in order to get better materials for upgrading weapons...

I'm now told to dismantle the already upgraded Blood Blade...

...and I get back raw materials!

Velvet calls it "kind of a hassle." I agree. She also calls it useful.

I go back and do the whole enhance-and-dismantle weapon system again for real with the Blood Blade...

...I dismantle our extra weapons, and we're set!

The guild's slowly spreading the news about Dyle's "death." One of them feels sorry for him...

We go back down the ladder...

They're now going to have the ship fixed. Rokurou though, thinks they need a proper crew to sail the ship, and wonders if there are "any free sailors around."

I engage in more battles and weapon customization in the village before heading to the shore...
