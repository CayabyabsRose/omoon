There's Grim in the tower.

She explains to us about a "second counting song" in the novel.

Phi reads the song:

"**When the eight malevolences overflow
In the culmination of mankind's despair
Innominat will bring an end to all peoples
And restore them to time immemorial.**

"**Four Empyreans shall wield a wrathful sword
And cleave the great devourer
Two asunder to sleep beneath the earth
As scarlet moonlight illuminates the evil.**

"**The nameless Empyrean hath one heart
The nameless Empyrean hath one body.**"

Velvet implies the song's referring to how Innominat operates.

Velvet reads the song again.

**Eizen:** "So when the world is at peak malevolence, **Innominat will use that power to 'bring an end to all,'** is that it?"

Eleanor's in shock at the revelation! Even Rokurou's gaping at the thought!

So the Abbey's true MO is to destroy the world once things get dire and start all over again. Oh my god...

Velvet denies the Shepherd being such a person. But he's getting there...

**Velvet:** "His two primary ideals are 'the many over one' and â€˜the restoration of order through will and reason.' He sacrificed Laphi to protect this world, not to eradicate it."

Well, Velvet's in for a surprise.

**Magilou:** "**People change, Velvet. Perhaps the Shepherd gave up hope. Maybe he lost faith in mankind...**"

Velvet wonders why did her brother get sacrificed for?

There's missing pages in the tome, says Grim.

Rokurou thinks there might be a full "original" copy of the tome.

Only the Abbey knows about the Empyreans.

Phi wonders where the original is...

Everyone decides to sleep on it until morning.

The expedition brought back another treasure: a **Model Craymel Cage!**

Since I know very little about *Tales of Eternia* lore, I decide to not look through the dialogue...

This is the last of the lands to explore...

Outside the docks, Kamoana and Medissa came to see us off!

Kamoana tells us about Medissa! She's really happy about her! Phi gets embarrassed...

Eleanor quickly changes the subject and tells about Dyle's new tail, he's up at the observation tower...she goes there to see it!

**Eleanor:** "Having some girl trouble, my little malak?"

Phi's happy that Kamoana and Medissa are happy. So is Eleanor.

Velvet tells Phi about their next task.

Eleanor chastises Velvet for her matter of factness. Velvet says she has to be since they're dealing with the Abbey.

Rokurou's asking to look for relocation this time.

Velvet's plan is to keep "on the offensive" and find the two therions.

**Rokurou:** "As a swordsman, I can respect that mindset."

Magilou says they're not staying in Titania forever. Velvet knows it too.

Phi finds an earthpulse point in east Eastgand!

Velvet's shocked at where the earthpulse point is!

Eizen decides that **Taliesin**'s our next stop.

Heee...Bienfu's looking at the seagull...

**Skit:** Rokurou points out Grim's character. She's honest, but not to the point of bluntness, Rokurou adds. He likes that.

Velvet and the others gets offended by his remarks. Rokurou's digging himself into a hole again...

Eleanor's thinking about the Shepherd pointing out her "lack of composure." Ignore what the Shepherd says, Eleanor.

Grim's dependable.

Magilou points out Grim's fan club has exactly "8,848 members strong!"

She has dinner shows?!

Phi's awed by Grim's popularity!

Eleanor's also thinking about Grim's "mannerisms" as benefits. She sighs...

Phi asks if she was doing an impression of Grim. Not intentionally...

Now Magilou eggs her on to do more impressions of Grimoirh.

Eleanor asks Phi about her impression.

The reactions of the party's faces are priceless!

Phi thinks it's passable.

**Skit:** Phi's reading one verse of the second song again.

**Phi:** "No matter how many times I read it, I don't see any good in it."

Eleanor asks if there's a different meaning for that song. She tries to spin it in a positive way, as in "the end to all" is "the end to all human suffering," which is no better!

Bienfu points out there might be grammatical errors in that copy...

Rokurou points that out too.

**Bienfu:** "I'm an expert at errors!"

Oh Bienfu, he takes up after his master...

More **skits** to slog through: Magilou asks Rokurou and Eizen who won the fishing contest. It's a draw, according to Eizen. Rokurou's not letting him have a win. They're counting points too!

Eizen's such a competitive sport. No wonder why he's the challenger at Character Cards...

Rokurou and Eizen decide to have a rematch.

Velvet's made the judge.

Phi asks what contest they're going to have next other than fishing.

Not cards for Eizen. Not chess for Rokurou, but he does know shogi.

Eleanor suggests arm wrestling. Magilou tosses that one out, as it's a cause to emit more malevolence...

Velvet suggests "a drinking contest..."

Ooh boy...

Bienfu's providing snacks!

Eizen then decides to continue his fishing contest against Rokurou. Oh my god, these guys...
