The *Van Eltia*'s still undergoing maintenance for now...

Kurogane's not letting one single gram of orichalcum be spared to make Rokurou's sword.

Rokurou asks Velvet if Kurogane could use the orichalcum for the blades. Velvet don't care, but he's polite to ask. Good for you, Rokurou.

Velvet doubts Kurogane would make a weapon, even Kurogane agrees, citing convention.

**Kurogane:** "But when has convention ever stopped a daemon? We're dealing with the hardest metal in existence. But I'm ready to cast aside all doubt...to focus everything on forging my greatest creation."

Rokurou and Velvet wish him good luck on forging that blade.

Bienfu asks Velvet to give him a nickname.

Magilou asks if Velvet's "practicing her dove impression." Oh boy...

Magilou asks what would happen if they were stopped again. Velvet decides to pull another "trick!" Magilou offers to teach her magic tricks for 10,000!

Magilou does bring good advice.

**Magilou:** "You have to perfect your art whether it be juggling or vengeance..."

Eleanor's trying to figure out most of which of the earthpulse points in the world have a therions in them.

She's deducing...

**Eleanor:** "If you're going to do somethig then give it your all. There is no other way to live!"

She's doing this for Laphicet and her. She wants to know the truth. She says that "I'm not doing this for you" line in a way that any bad-guy-turned-good in another show could relate to.

Velvet understands why Laphicet's helping her out so much...but, she needs to show her appreciation more, says Eleanor.

Laphicet and Kamoana are talking. Kamoana wants to play I Spy with Phi...they do so. Kamoana spies with her little eye, a V! Velvet...

Kamoana cries...

**Velvet:** "Poor Phi..."

Kamoana's still angry that Laphicet won her I Spy game so easily...she does look up to Prince Percival as "a wise being."

Percival just read something about men somewhere in a novel. He is a bit like Estelle.

Velvet's wearing Horns while Phi's wearing an Angel Halo...

The pirates want to make sweets for Kamoana...

Velvet smiles at Phi. Awwww...

**Velvet:** "Hey, what do you say we track down another therion?"<br/>
**Phi:** "Sure. From what I can tell, the next closest earthpulse is near the center of Midgand."

Back to the belly of the beast...

Velvet's thinking about the condition of the capital now that Griffin's out of the villa...

Rokurou thinks going there's the better option.

Eleanor says Eizen hasn't showed up...

Where is he?

Rokurou sees a letter on the ground and reads it...Oh boy...Rokurou, you snoop.

**Velvet** points that out: "It's rude to read other people's letters."

But who does the letter belong to? And who is it being sent to?

Laphicet reads the sender. It's not a common name, it looks like a ciphered name...

Velvet guesses they must have been on the island.

**Velvet:** "Hey! Anybody lose a letter?" I like the way she said that line.

We now look for the letter writer...

At the docks, there's Eizen!

He's asking if a girl, or a woman, is okay...the White Turtlez says she's okay...

He now offers Eizen a sunflower print to wrap the pot with. Eizen takes it. It's "cute."

Rokurou's gaping in surprise at what he just heard.

Eizen sees them!

Velvet asks if someone dropped a letter...

...and someone whooshes it away at full speed!

Everyone's gaping in surprise. Don't laugh, guys!

Rokurou lies right to the reaper's face...a bit.

The extreme close-ups on this skit...oh my god...

Oh boy. The tension is rising.

He sends the letter with the pot...

Velvet tells him about their mission. Everyone leaves but Rokurou and Laphicet, wondering who he was sending a gift to...

Laphicet and Rokurou compliment the "ol' Reeps'" penmanship.

**Eizen:** "**I can hear you two, you know!?**"

Holy heck...

**Skit:** Magilou wonders about Velvet giving Laphicet a nickname, which Magilou says as a "token effort," wondering that "maybe [she was] trying to encourage him to be his own being."

Magilou points out that Velvet made malak!Laphicet into his own person...it's a bit heartwarming.

Magilou asks Velvet for a nickname. Velvet mentions that "she just forced" herself in the crew. Magilou **begs** for one, though...yikes.

Velvet calls her "Magi.' Magilou's not satisfied.

The whole scene ends up with Velvet calling her: "Witchy McWitcherton." If Yuri was part of the crew, he'd think of a good one for Magilou...

**Magilou:** "A nickname needs to have charm. It needs to have a lasting impression."

Velvet starts calling her "Hatty," "Bookskirt," "Ms. Creepy Eyes." Velvet's enjoying this...

And Velvet ends up with one that's true of Magilou's personality, but too long to name...

**Next skit:** The octopuses that the crew slew, still alive, are now being made into food for Kamoana. Eeee...

**Rokurou:** "A therion needs malevolence to survive."

**Eizen** mentions the menu for Kamoana: "Octopus ink pasta with takoyaki and fried octopus on the side, and Hellawesian octopus carpaccio."

Kurogane made a takoyaki pan too!

Velvet's warmly smiling at the idea of octopus ink pasta...

Laphicet explains the differences between squid ink and octopus ink.

Velvet calls back to her brother Laphi, saying "octopus ink pasta doesn't taste very good."

Phi offers to eat some octopus ink pasta.

Percival calls his hawk Grawky, and asks him to find "something nice" for Kamoana.

**Next skit:** Rokurou wonders about Eizen's gift.

Laphicet doesn't want to think about messing with Batman pirate malak again...poor Phi...

Rokurou thinks Eizen's writing to a girlfriend...

The subtitles mention a pot, but Rokurou says "cooking pot."

Phi guesses the girl Eizen's sending the present to must be the "girl with the yellow umbrella."

Rokurou teases Phi. Stop that, Rokurou. 

Eleanor and Magilou come in.

Phi mentions the sunflower print wrap reminds him of the yellow umbrella girl...

Velvet comes in, glad that "Eizen has someone to write to."

Rokurou points out Velvet eavesdropping. She blushes.

**Fourth skit:** Eleanor asks about Eizen, his tastes, and his everyday habits.

Magilou mentions Eizen's habits: eating curry every weekend. Mmmm...Curry...

And he wants his pasta cooked a certain way...and he has the same outfit done for him. Same size, same color.

Velvet calls him "a pain".

Eleanor likes that "meticulous" side of Eizen.

More skits to go. I hope this is the last one...

Eizen flips his coin. It lands on tails again! Rokurou and Laphicet want to see Eizen land his coin on heads.

Rokurou decides to bring in "something special." A coin with two heads!

Eleanor calls it cheating. 

**Eizen:** "It's effort and hard work."

He flips the coin. Then the crow flies off with it! Eizen can't win no matter what. Poor Eizen...

Rokurou brings up another backup coin...

Whoa, what!? Eleanor points out Griffin's taken the coin with him...

Does Rokurou have a third two-headed coin?

This is too funny...

He does have a backup!

Eizen flips that coin: the coin broke!

**Rokurou:** "You gotta be kidding me! Does [the Reaper's Curse] have to go this far over a damn coin?"

Eizen's resigned to his fate.

Grim's looking out at the docks...

She asks Eizen why he lives at sea "since he's an earth malak..."

**Eizen:** "I live on the sea **because** I'm an earth malak." So in a metaphorical way, he's the land moving on the sea...

Eizen tells a story about Aifread laughing at "the idea of a pirate who couldn't swim." Poor Eizen...

Then he started "tough training" to destroy that weakness...

Then he mentions all that tough training, starting at a lake, then a river, and at an ocean. The waters weren't so kind to him...

**Grimoirh:** "The Reaper's Curse at play...?"

Eizen mentions his hard work and determination to ensure that his elemental affinity and curse didn't stop him...

Grim asks if he **did** learn how to swim...he did... but he still needs his life preserver.

Benwick asks about Griffin's hunts. The hawk's bringing in enormous fish now, especially swordfish! The hawk drops it on the ship!

Laphicet mentions the Prince's happiness when Grawky flies free...

So Kamoana thought of Griffin's nickname: Grawky.

Eizen points out the freedom that the Prince is experiencing for the first time in his life.

Magilou points out that Griffin's got an "elephant tuna!" Oh my god...is she exaggerating?

Elephant tuna can sell up to **20 million gald!?**

Benwick's eyes light up at the money. Eizen's not happy though, as the elephant tuna's about to damage the *Van Eltia*!

Eizen and Benwick run to stop Griffin from dropping the tuna! Lol...

Cut to black. It seems Griffin dropped the tuna into the sea...

I go inside, where everyone has something new to say.

Magilou (or Kamoana?) wants to play a game of I Spy...Velvet can't see what she's spying this time.

Rokurou asks Eizen about the girl with the yellow umbrella. He's getting nowhere.

Prince Percival's still in trouble for what Griffin did on the ship...

...and this ends tonight's session!
