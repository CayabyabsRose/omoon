Happy New Year, everybody! Hopefully, everyone had a nice holiday, or at least a satisfying one so far.

Anyway, I've also made a breakthrough with version 0.7 of this site: I've added a comment system!

Thanks to the folks at [IntenseDebate](http://www.intensedebate.com), anyone can place their input at all of the random posts and liveblogs I make anytime.

And that's it for now, I guess.

P.S. If anyone wants to edit their comments on this site, I suggest getting an IntenseDebate account.
