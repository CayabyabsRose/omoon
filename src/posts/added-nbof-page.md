Hello, everyone! I've just added the main blog page for my liveblog of *Natsume's Book of Friends*! In other news, this site is now more secure thanks to [GitHub providing custom domain pages with added HTTPS encryption!](https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/) 

In the meantime, I'll continue to upload my playthroughs of *Secret of Mana* and *Tales of Berseria* from the previous two weeks!

My next plans are to change up the layout of this site. But before I do, I'll add in some extra goodies like an About page, Reviews, and finally, make use of that empty Trivia page!

And that's it for now!
