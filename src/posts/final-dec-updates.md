I'm completely surprised that I finished *Super Mario RPG* just today! Now the laborious task of putting all the notes I've written on my phone and into both the blog and my IntenseDebate comments begin!

Now that I've finished with that game, my next plan is to do a Double Feature playthrough, where I'll be playing *two* games in one go next year after my trip, since I really want to get through my list, and to get started on games I've been wanting to get to! 

How I'll manage to do this is that I'll start with the first game in one week, and the second one in the other, and go back to the first one in the third week, and so on, hopefully as a way to keep things a bit organized.

As a sneak preview, one of the games I'll be playing is...

*Secret of Mana*!

I'll probably get around to writing up all of my old playthroughs and put them up on the site soon. Maybe I'll also get other features working, and fix a few bugs if I have time.

Again, Happy Holidays, everybody, and have a good New Year too! :christmas_tree:
