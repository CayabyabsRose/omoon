Alright, I'm back!

For now, I'm making some small touches on one of my personal projects, relaxing for a bit, gaining progress on the new game I'm playing through, which I'll mention in a bit, and preparing for another out-of-town trip. In the meantime, for this site, I'll continue to upload old posts that I was supposed to have up by January until Monday, which is when I'll be leaving.

I've also updated both the *Berseria* and *Gaia* masterlists (for *Berseria*, it's up till the end of Act IV, and for *Gaia*, up to Part 53), and added a new playthrough on the liveblogs page for the game I'm currently playing at the moment: *Terranigma*.

I'm planning to post a lot of stuff unrelated to my playthroughs that's seriously overdue, but I'm going to have to delay that after my trip next week, so please stay tuned!
