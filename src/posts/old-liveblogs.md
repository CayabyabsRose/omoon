It seems that I've managed to find some of my liveblogs from last year that I accidentally deleted from my phone trying to clear out some space from there. They were actually super-buried in my gmail account, and I did not notice they were there until now.

Now the next plan is to edit them a bit before putting them up here, and to **finally** start liveblogging my second game that I was supposed to get to a few days ago.

When it comes to games like this one (especially when it comes to this game), I get either nervous, lazy, or both that I end up holding them off indefinitely. Has that actually happened to any of you guys so far? You wanted to play this game that you heard was great only to delay playing it because of those feelings? I'm sorry for being so vague about this, but I really want to keep this game a surprise until I start playing it.
