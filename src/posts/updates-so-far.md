I've got the [**masterlist**](../../liveblogs/alundra/masterlist/) for *Alundra* complete, but I haven't uploaded the actual posts yet. The masterlist there lists what's going to be posted for my liveblog of the game in around the next few days or so.

Aside from that, I'm also considering putting up a comments system, with an RSS feed, and other goodies just to get some traffic on this site.
