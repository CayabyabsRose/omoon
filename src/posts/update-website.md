Okay, I've already got my first transcript link up, along with the first parts of the masterlist of my replaythrough of *Dust: An Elysian Tail* and my liveblog of *Natsume's Book of Friends*!

Hopefully, I'll get the main page for both of these up, provided I don't either get lazy doing this, since it's a lot of work copy-pasting (and in some cases, rewriting) these liveblogs!
