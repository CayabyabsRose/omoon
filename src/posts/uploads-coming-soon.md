Hello everyone! I've uploaded the bulk of my old playthroughs here, and will continue to do so until I'm caught up to where I am currently, which is on the tail end of **Terranigma**.

Note some of the content in these play/watchthroughs have slight additions, redactions, and grammar corrections. That's because the versions I'm publishing exclusively on this blog are the uncensored, complete versions as I intended them to be.

Here is the order of the posts I'm uploading:

**Alundra** -> **Dust: An Elysian Tail** -> the rest of **Super Mario RPG**<br/>
**Illusion of Gaia** -> **Terranigma**<br/>
**Tales of Berseria** -> the watchthroughs -> the readthroughs

Hope everyone's staying safe so far!
