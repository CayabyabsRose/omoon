A little bit of news: I've now finally got emojis working on this site! :smile:

Meanwhile, I'm still trying to finish up *Super Mario RPG* and get some progress done on my other projects before I leave for my out-of-town trip this Christmas and New Year's.

I've also updated the masterlists, now called episode lists, of both *Voltron: LD*, adding in the Season 1 episodes to make it look a bit complete, and *Natsume's Book of Friends* up to Season 5. I'm hoping to watch a little bit of Season 6 before the trip! 

Oh yeah, after I'm finished with *Super Mario RPG*, I'm planning to continue down the list of games I have to play, with a little surprise... :wink:

I'm also planning to add new (and old) content along the way, so keep an eye out for them!

Until then, Happy Holidays to you all! :christmas_tree:
