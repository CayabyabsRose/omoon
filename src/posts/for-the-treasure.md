I stumbled upon a [demo of this game][ftt] on YouTube earlier this morning, and I'm considering whether to download it and play it for fun or not, since it's a pretty interesting one.

For one thing, [the guy][driftwood] playing through it thought the game overall was great, and it had, in his words, "a sense of polish". But what caught my eye were the characters on the image banner to the video, especially with their designs and contrasting personalities. Without spoiling anything, its semi-atypical [battle system][ctb] and interesting beginning was what literally sold me on this game!

Although, the main problem is that I don't have [RPG Maker MV][rmmv]. I wonder if it's playable even without the game engine...

[Here's the game's official website](http://forthetreasure.com/). As a bonus, they even have a webcomic for this game!
