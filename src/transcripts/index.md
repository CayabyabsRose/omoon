<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2.25em;">Transcripts</h2>

This is the main page for the transcripts of interviews and speeches from people that I consider to be important voices. It's also a good resource base for anyone doing research to look into.

Note that most of these links are not ready yet. I'll try and get them up if I'm not too busy.
