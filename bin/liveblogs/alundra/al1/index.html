<p>Exciting stuff in the opening here, with some pieces of gameplay of what to expect, though I might have been spoiled at some places now.</p>
<p>I wonder who the girl is though?</p>
<p>I&#39;m at the sea, sailing to unknown lands...</p>
<p>I only have a dagger equipped with me, no money or anything important yet.</p>
<p>The square button instead of the x button is the attack button and the button to talk to other people, but the x button, oddly enough, is for accepting decisions.</p>
<p>After talking to someone returning to their beloved, he says my character&#39;s dreams actually led me to sail on this ship to Torla, or to the village of Inoa, according to one of the sailors there. Some of the ship&#39;s crew is being judgy and harsh.</p>
<p>I can also pick up and throw stuff with the square button, and jump with x.</p>
<p>I wander around the ship now, and talk to Captain Merrick, he thinks I&#39;m seasick.</p>
<p>I wander some more and I find out the triangle button dashes my character.</p>
<p>Everyone tells me to go back to my cabin, a storm&#39;s brewing soon. I go back to my cabin and sleep.</p>
<p>Oh my god! Some person named Lars, a sealed wizard, is calling to my character. Who is he? Why was he locked up?</p>
<p>The music is not playing happy tunes, that&#39;s for sure! I also see a village too.</p>
<p>Lars mentions that north of Inoa is a deep, dark lake where some foul beast lies, and my character is called the Releaser by Lars.</p>
<p>Some demonic person in blue with glowing eyes named Melzas taunts Lars, saying humans are beneath him, what?</p>
<p>Lars taunts Melzas back, calling him a coward, afraid of humanity, or the things humanity is capable of.</p>
<p>Melzas vanishes and Lars is also gone too, with a last request that I head for Inoa ASAP.</p>
<p>Now my character wakes up to the ship shaking because of the storm, not good! The door from my cabin&#39;s now jammed shut too!</p>
<p>I get out via the broken wall on the other side, and the ship has crashed onto the reefs!</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m ashore, but unconscious, and there&#39;s a guy coming!</p>
<p>I wake up in a house, where the guy that saved me is a swordsmith named Jess. His job pays good money and he has decent hours, according to him.</p>
<p>So my character&#39;s name is Alundra, and the ship that I was on was the <em>Klark</em>.</p>
<p>Jess pokes fun at himself, and mentions a diary near the bed, a save point.</p>
<p>Now I can wander around the house and I have a heads-up display now.</p>
