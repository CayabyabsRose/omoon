<p>I talk to a gravekeeper named Cephas who thinks cemeteries are representations of heaven.</p>
<p>I meet my first enemies here too, hello Slime and Wasp!</p>
<p>A watermill with three treasure chests are there, but I can&#39;t seem to reach it, since iron bars are in the way, oh well...</p>
<p>I arrive near the gates at Tarn&#39;s Manor. I explore some more around the area though.</p>
<p>I end up going to a cabin at the beach, and someone named Nava tells me to leave for my own safety. Huh? What does he mean?</p>
<p>There may be no lifeguards on duty in the beach, but there are fire-breathing rock turtles on duty!</p>
