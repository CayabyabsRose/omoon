<p>I head back to Tarn&#39;s Manor, and as soon as I&#39;m at the gates, some monkeys with wolverine claws came from the manor and jumped at me! Nothing was stolen and no harm done though!</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m inside the manor proper. Melzas warns me with his big, blue spectre hologram body, and locks the doors with his mind, and more monkeys jump at me!</p>
<p>I go in the formerly locked door in the center of the hall into the dining room where more monkeys start jumping at me!</p>
<p>I beat them and get a chest of strength tonic for my trouble, which I can&#39;t carry since I already have one.</p>
<p>I explore around the manor some more and am now at the basement of the manor. Two slimes are there to greet me.</p>
<p>A huge rock falls on me as I move forward, ouch! I now see why Alundra can dash.</p>
<p>I do more simple puzzles and get more treasure, such as herbs and a Gilded Falcon! I&#39;m wondering what the falcon does though...</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of spiked balls in this manor. I wonder if Tarn had a thing for spiked balls.</p>
<p>After the sewage exploits, I get a Life Vessel upgrading my health yes!!!</p>
<p>I&#39;m now back at the main entrance, and after getting the tonic, I head upstairs. The suits of armor creep me out though, it feels like they might attack me for some reason.</p>
<p>The monkeys with wolverine claws are a bit troublesome, and I use the key from the sewer to open the door in the middle of the hall.</p>
<p>I go in and get the <strong>Book of Elna</strong>, probably the thing that Septimus asked me to find.</p>
<p>Melzas introduces himself to Alundra, giving out vague threats again by hologram. Yes, I&#39;ve heard your stuff before, pleasegoaway.</p>
<p>No boss though? Pretty anticlimactic.</p>
<p>After checking my menu for the book, I head back to the village.</p>
<p>Jess criticizes me for going into Tarn&#39;s Manor alone. Well, at least I got my thirst for adventure quenched.</p>
<p>I like the way the save points are recorded via diary, terms like &quot;checking the parchment,&quot; and the &quot;tale has been recorded successfully&quot; makes it feel a bit immersive.</p>
